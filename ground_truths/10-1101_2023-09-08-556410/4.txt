INTRODUCTION
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) regulates inhibitory function in the mammalian brain.
Substantial evidence for reduced GABAergic function during the aging process, regarding both
synthesis and receptor expression, has been reported in human and animal models (e.g.,
McQuail, Frazier, & Bizon, 2015; Rozycka and Liguz-Lecznar, 2017). Cross-sectional magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies in humans have shown reduced regional GABA in older
adults (Gao et al., 2013; Porges et al., 2017; Cuypers et al., 2020; Chamberlain et al., 2021; for
contrast, see Pitchaimuthu et al., 2017). Recently, our group demonstrated that GABA declines
gradually and nonlinearly with age (Porges et al., 2021).
Lower cortical GABA levels are associated with worse global cognition, fluid processing,
sensorimotor performance, and memory performance in normative aging (Porges et al., 2017;
Simmonite et al., 2019; Cassady et al., 2019; Murari et al., 2020; Jiménez-Balado et al., 2021;

reviewed in Li et al., 2022). However, few studies of cortical GABA levels have included oldest-
old adults (85 years and older), and none have compared young-old and old-old adults (Porges et

al., 2017; Simmonite et al., 2019). The oldest-old, particularly the cognitively-intact oldest-old,
may disproportionately carry longevity-related physiological traits or engage in protective
behaviors (Silverman and Schmeidler et al., 2018; Kawas, Legdeur, & Corrada, 2021);
“successful agers” may thereby be atypically resistant to neuropathology or able to compensate
for neuropathology (e.g., Berlau et al., 2009). Given the association between GABA and
cognition in normative aging, maintained GABAergic function may be protective in the
cognitively-intact oldest-old (e.g., by reducing excitotoxic injury).
We describe GABA levels among cognitively-intact oldest-old adults, incorporating four novel
datasets into a previously-reported individual participant data meta-analysis (Porges et al., 2021).
We report stabilization in the slope of age-related GABA decline among the cognitively-intact
oldest-old, potentially related to survivorship in this subpopulation.
RESULTS
To test the linearity of GABA-age relationships in oldest-old adults, we fit separate linear
regression models (Table 1); data were feature-scaled by dividing raw scores by their geometric
mean to increase comparability between datasets. No model explained more than 10% of
variance per R2

, consistent with nonlinear relationships or high inter-individual variability.
