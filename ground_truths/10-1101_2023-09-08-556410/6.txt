DISCUSSION
Although GABA declines with age and may be implicated in sustaining normal cognitive
performance, few studies have examined age-related GABA differences in oldest-old adults
(85+). Our individual participant data meta-analysis revealed that the slope of age-related
differences in cortical GABA appears to flatten in cognitively-intact oldest-old adults; supporting
this finding, the velocity of change in GABA decreases after age 80, apparently reflecting the
introduction into the model of a large number of cognitively-intact oldest-old individuals in this
age group, and only begins to increase again by 90. In the context of a positive GABA-cognition
association, this descriptive finding is consistent with the possibility of a GABA “floor” below
which cognitive function is unlikely to remain intact in oldest-old age.
The reported effect may be driven in part by survivorship and sample selection. All participants
met an inclusion threshold of 22 or higher on the MoCA, reflecting grossly-intact cognitive
performance. Successfully-aging oldest-old adults are a subset of a highly-selected, atypical
