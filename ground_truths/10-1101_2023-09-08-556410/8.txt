Figure 3. Smoothed GABA spline data are superimposed over a conceptual model of age-related
cognitive change. Age-associated differences in GABA may function as a biological influence
modulating trajectories of cognition in aging (Hertzog et al., 2008). Figure adapted from Hertzog
et al. (2008).
Strengths of our analysis include the individual participant data meta-analytic approach,
which allows us to leverage datasets covering the full lifespan; additionally, our Markov Chain
Monte Carlo approach, in which dataset-specific feature scaling factors and the spline model are
estimated simultaneously, reduces the impact of inter-dataset methodological heterogeneity on
our model. However, our analysis has several limitations. First, although our model represents
the full lifespan, all included data are cross-sectional. Therefore, we cannot report individual
participantsâ€™ cognitive trajectories; some participants with currently-intact cognitive function
may have borne neuropathology undetected due to strong compensatory abilities or high baseline
function (Stern, 2009) and may ultimately experience cognitive decline, while others may sustain

cognitive function throughout their lives. Second, although all participants were cognitively-
intact, we did not directly examine association between GABA and cognitive performance; while

prior evidence from mixed young-old and oldest-old samples (e.g., Porges et al., 2017) is
consistent with an association, it is also possible that, given sufficient GABA levels to maintain
