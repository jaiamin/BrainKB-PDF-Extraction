Abstract

Cortical GABA levels are reduced in older age; age-related differences in GABA may be
associated with age-related cognitive change. The nature of age-related GABA differences in the
highest-functioning stratum of the oldest-old (85+) population is not yet known. We extend our
previously-reported Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis of GABA levels (Porges et al.,
2021) across the lifespan with four novel datasets sampling the cognitively-intact oldest-old. The
slope of age-related GABA differences in cognitively-intact oldest-old adults flattens after
roughly age 80. We interpret these findings as an effect of survivorship: inclusion in the study
required intact cognition, and too great a reduction of GABA levels may not be compatible with
neurophysiological function needed for intact cognition. This work contributes to a growing
body of evidence suggesting that successful cognitive aging may require intact GABAergic
function, as well as further characterizing successful aging amongst oldest-old adults.
