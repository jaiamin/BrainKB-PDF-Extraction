To characterize nonlinear GABA trajectory in oldest-old age, we fit a nonlinear penalized basis
spline model incorporating data previously reported in Porges et al. (2021); the mean spline and
credible interval are shown in Figure 1. The first derivative of the basis spline model was also
generated, reflecting the change in velocity of GABA+ decline in oldest-old age; the first
derivative after age 60 is inset in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Penalized basis spline model of cortical GABA concentrations across the lifespan. The
inset figure depicts a portion of the first derivative of the basis spline model, reflecting the
change in steepness of the GABA slope with increasing age.
We additionally examined posterior estimates of the relative scaling factor Fs; Fs represents the
dataset-specific scaling factor required to bring methodologically heterogeneous data into
common units (see Methods). Estimated Fs for each dataset, log-scaled to emphasize ratios and
centered to mean Fs, is plotted in Figure 2. Estimates of Fs for the four Cr-referenced novel
datasets, like estimates from the three other Cr-referenced datasets (Mikkelsen, Gao, and
Simmonite), were smaller than estimates for water-referenced datasets, suggesting consistency
between datasets using similar methodologies.
