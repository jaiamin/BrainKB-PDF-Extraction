All analyses were conducted in R 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2022) using the cmdstanr package to
implement Stan 2.21.0 (Stan Development Team, 2021). Following the approach of Porges et al.
(2021), posterior probability distributions were estimated for all parameters simultaneously using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This approach permits estimates to covary appropriately
for non-linear regression. For each model, we fit the overall function, a global error term, and
one feature scaling factor Fs per dataset. Fs is the estimated multiplier needed to bring each
dataset into standardized units with an overall geometric mean of 1.0, thereby correcting for
systematic methodological differences. This approach assumes that data within a single dataset
are comparable, that all data reflect a similar underlying lifespan trajectory, and that age ranges
overlap between datasets. We generated Fs as in Porges et al. (2021), weakly penalizing to
discourage unlikely extreme values at the tails of the distribution and excluding negative values
by setting a lower bound.
We initially fit separate linear regressions in Stan predicting GABA+/Cr+PCr concentrations
from age for each of the four novel datasets. We then fit a penalized cubic basis spline model
(Kharratzadeh 2017; Porges et al. 2021), which imposes few assumptions on the shape of the
dataset. 19 knots were spaced evenly throughout the model and a smoothing parameter was
imposed to minimize overfitting (Kharratzadeh 2017). To quantify the change in model slope
with the addition of the four novel datasets, we took the first derivative of the model, which
represents the velocity of GABA+ change across the lifespan.
