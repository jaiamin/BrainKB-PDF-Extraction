ABSTRACT
The goal of this study was to characterize a model that specifically activates peripheral
nociceptors, allowing pure nociceptive thresholds to be monitored over a range of conditions
including pathology or in screening analgesic compounds. Transgenic mice expressing
channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in cell populations positive for the transient receptor potential
cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) gene were bred to enable peripheral
nociceptor photostimulation. Preliminary experiments confirmed the expected localisation
pattern of ChR2 positive profiles in the dorsal root ganglion and superficial dorsal horn,
mirroring TPRV1 expression. Brief hindpaw photostimulation with 470nm light caused
hindpaw withdrawal and nocifensive behaviours in ChR2 positive animals but not control
ChR2 negative animals. Using a simplified up/down approach, â€˜optical' nociceptive
thresholds were assessed with a 5-intensity hindpaw photostimulation paradigm, establishing
the minimum intensity required to produce a withdrawal response (optical threshold). All
testing was also video recorded and analysed post-hoc to assess additional photostimulation
evoked behaviours. Repeated testing over several days showed optical nociceptive thresholds
and response duration were similar, supporting the stability of these variables across a
timeframe relevant to onset of pathology or drug administration. Optical nociceptive
thresholds were also assessed following morphine administration (30 mg/kg), which
significantly raised thresholds, highlighting analgesic screening utility of this model.
Together, these findings demonstrate the peripheral photostimulation with optical
thresholding is a useful addition to the preclinical nociception assessment toolkit, with the
key advantage of inducing a purely nociceptive response to a non-invasive, non-tissue
damaging stimulus.
