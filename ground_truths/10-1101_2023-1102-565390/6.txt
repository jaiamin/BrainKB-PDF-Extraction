related peptide (CGRP, 1:200 in 0.1 M PBS, Abcam, ab36001) and neurofilament 200
(NF200, DRG sections only, 1:5000 in 0.1 M PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, N0142). After the
primary incubation, sections were washed 3 x 15 min with 0.1 M PBS prior to a 2-hour
incubation in secondary antibodies FITC (1:50 in 0.1 M PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch,
703-095-155), Cy3 (1:50 in antibody diluent, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-165-147) and
AMCA (DRG sections only, 1:50 in antibody diluent, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-155-
151) at room temperature. Sections were washed in 0.1 M PBS 3 x 15 min, mounted on slides
with buffered glycerol and cover slipped. Slides were subsequently imaged on Olympus
BX50 microscope (10X and 20X objectives), and analyzed using Image J software (NIH,
New York, USA).

In vivo photostimulation and behavioural testing
The testing apparatus consisted of a clear plexiglass cylinder was placed on top of an elevated
plexiglass floor. A video camera was positioned in front of the testing setup to record all
behaviours with 2 mirrors positioned behind the testing arena to capture behaviour from all
angles. Under the elevated plexiglass floor, an LED driver (Thor Labs, New Jersey, USA)
connected to 470 nm fibre-coupled LED (Thor Labs, New Jersey, USA) provided
photostimulation through its attachment with a fibre optic patch cable, ceramic ferrule
connection and optic fibre tip (300 μm) mounted on a fixed height stand. The LED driver was
controlled by a Master-8 (AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel) pulse stimulator, delivering 1-second
TTL pulses when triggered (Figure 1A). Set photostimulation intensities were calibrated
using a digital optical power meter with a photodiode sensor positioned, sensor side down, on
the elevated plexiglass flooring above the light path and the LED (Thor Labs, New Jersey,
USA). This calibration procedure was performed on experimental days to ensure LED output
accuracy.

All experiments were conducted under quiet, low-light conditions at 22 ± 1°C and 50%
relative humidity. Animals were acclimatised in the testing arena for a minimum of 30 min or
until responses to the novel environment were diminished (i.e. minimal rearing, pushing or
scratching plexiglass, and unprovoked grooming). During acclimatization, the experimenter
periodically adjusted the LED ferrule position under the floor, without triggering
photostimulation, as would occur during testing. A minimum of three acclimatization
sessions were performed prior to an experimental protocol commenced with at least 24 hrs
