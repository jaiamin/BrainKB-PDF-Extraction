Importantly, no differences were detected in optical withdrawal thresholds between baseline
and vehicle trials (0.55 ± 0.15 mW vs. 0.62 ± 0.19 mW), withdrawal latency (0.44 ± 0.06 s
vs. 0.49 ± 0.09 s), and response duration (0.86 ± 0.40 s vs. 0.33 ± 0.16 s). In contrast,
morphine significantly increased the optical withdrawal threshold compared to both baseline
and vehicle (1.98 ± 0.27 mW vs. 0.55 ± 0.15 mW vs. 0.62 ± 0.19 mW, morphine vs. baseline
vs. vehicle; p < 0.001; Figure 5). Given the change in optical threshold evoked by morphine,
for threshold comparisons of withdrawal latency and duration, to baseline and vehicle results,
morphine was assigned the maximum possible value of 1.5 s for latency and the minimum
value of 0s for response duration. These results indicate the peripheral photostimulation
model is sensitive to morphine analgesia supporting its utility as a novel analgesic efficacy
screening tool.
