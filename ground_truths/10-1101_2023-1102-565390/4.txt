study pain signalling evoked in the periphery, as well as activation at the level of the spinal
cord [13; 19; 20; 35; 40]. While a range of strategies have been used to express
channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in nociceptive afferents and other cell populations, several
studies have used the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1
(TRPV1) to establish optogenetic control of nociceptors [5; 9; 12; 13; 21; 25; 26; 37].
Importantly, the TRPV1 ion channel mediates heat and chemically induced nociception,
through expression in mechanically insensitive unmyelinated c-fibres [24; 30; 41]. Thus,
photostimulation of this population in TRPV1::ChR2 mice, by applying 470 nm light to the
central or peripheral nervous systems, can produce nociceptive signaling [5; 9; 12; 13; 21; 25;
26; 37]. Several studies have shown that under in vivo conditions peripheral optogenetic
activation of nociceptors provokes nocifensive responses that can then be recorded and
analysed [9; 30; 2; 13]. In building on this approach, work presented here describes an optical
thresholding protocol, delivering set intensities of increasing photostimulation until a
nocifensive hindpaw withdrawal response is elicited. This provides a form of nociceptive
threshold that can then be monitored without tissue contact or injury and can assess changes
in purely nociceptive signaling during the induction of pathological pain or as an analgesic
efficacy screening model for novel compounds.
