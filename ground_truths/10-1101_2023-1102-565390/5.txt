METHODS

All experimental procedures were conducted at the University of Newcastle in accordance
with the University’s Animal Care and Ethics Committee guidelines (protocol A-2021-134).

Animals
Experimental mice were derived by crossing TRPV1Cre with Ai32 (Jackson Laboratories, Bar
Harbor, Maine, USA; lines #024109 and #017769, respectively). This generated offspring
with ChR2/EYFP expressed in TRPV1 positive sensory neurons and their peripheral and
central terminals. Both male and female mice (TRPV1Cre;Ai32; 3-6 months) were used as
experimental animals. The uncrossed Ai32 parent line was used to confirm ChR2 activation
underpinned responses to stimuli.

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue was prepared for immunofluorescence confirmation of ChR2 expression and
localization by animal overdose with pentobarbitone (800 mg/kg, i.p.; Virbac, NSW,
Australia) followed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer.
The spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were there dissected free and post-fixed for
an additional 2 hours in the same fixative. Transverse spinal cord sections prepared from the
lumbar enlargement (L3-L5, 30 μm) embedded in TissueTek (Sakura Finetek, California,
USA) and sectioned at -20°C on a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
Alternatively, DRGs were polyethylene glycol (PEG) embedded after a series of washing and
clearing steps: 3 x 15 min 80% ethanol (EtOH), 3 x 15 min dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
then 3 x 15 min 100% EtOH. DRGs were then placed melted 1000MW PEG in a 46OC
vacuum oven (Thermoline, NSW, Australia) until the tissue sank (approximately 2 hrs). The
tissue was then embedded in 1450MW PEG, hardened, and sectioned (20 μm) on a
microtome (American Optical, Illinois, USA).

Tissue sections from both the spinal cords and DRGs were placed in 10% normal donkey
serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Pennsylvania, USA) in antibody diluent (0.3 M NaCl, 7.5
mM NaH2PO4, 0.3% TritonX-1000, 0.05% Na+ Azide), for 1 hour to block non-specific

antibody binding. Sections were incubated overnight in primary antibodies against green-
fluorescent protein (GFP, 1:1000 in antibody diluent, Abcam, ab13970), calcitonin gene-
