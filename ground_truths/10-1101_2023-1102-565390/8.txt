inactive), as well as during and post photostimulation (hindpaw lifting, tapping, grooming).
Video recordings also determine the latency between photostimulation onset and the first
behavioural response. Once coded, behaviour data (e.g., hindpaw lifting, tapping, or
grooming) was exported in 1-second bins. Our analysis also grouped behaviours (e.g.,
nocifensive = lifting/tapping/grooming) and normalized these to account for photostimulation
exposure when hindpaw withdrawal reduced the photostimulation period. This normalization
multiplied the response duration by the fraction of the photostimulation period (1-second)
that achieved hindpaw exposure.

Drugs and drug administration
Morphine (5 mg/mL; Pfizer, New york, USA) was prepared in isotonic saline was prepared
immediately prior to administration. Morphine and vehicle (isotonic saline) were
administered s.c. into the scruff of the neck at a volume of 5 mL/kg, and morphine at a
dosage of 10 mg/kg.

Statistics
Data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistical package (V28, IBM, New York, USA). Data
were first examined to determine whether it satisfied the assumptions underlying analysis of

variance. Repeated measures ANOVAs paired with post-hoc Tukey’s HSD or the non-
parametric equivalent Friedman test paired with post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were

used to compare parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. All data are presented as
mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
