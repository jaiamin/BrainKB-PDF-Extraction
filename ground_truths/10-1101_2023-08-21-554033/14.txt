6 Material and Methods
6.1 MEA fabrication and Pt deposition
We fabricate our MEAs on a set of borosilicate glass wafers (Borofloat 33) ranging from 3 to 6 inches in diameter.
The process starts with spin-coating of AZ5214E photoresist (PR) using a Headway PWM32 spin coater at a steady
speed of 3000 rpm. Photolithography is then performed using the Heidelberg MLA 150 Maskless Aligner through
a 375nm laser source with a dose of 210mJ/cm2

. Developing is subsequently performed for 30s using 1:4 diluted
AZ400K developer, followed by a 50s post bake at 120◦C. Next, the AJA sputter coater series are leveraged for
constitutive material deposition. Ti and Pt are both deposited at 3mT pressure, with respective power of 200W
and 50W, while ITO is deposited at 5mT pressure, 80W power, and under the airflow of argon and 3% oxygen.
Samples are then submerged in acetone for lift-off. We then employ Oxford PECVD to apply a 500nm passivation
layer of Si3N4, which is produced with the supply of 20sccm of SiH4 and NH3 respectively, under 650mT pressure
and 20W power. The second photolithography process is carried out using the same aforementioned parameter
settings. The exposed passivation material is removed using Oxford Freon RIE with 30sccm CF4 as the etching gas.
Finally, the sample is cleaned with acetone and diced using a wafer cutter. An illustration of our full fabrication
process can be found in SI.
To electroplate the Pt black, we first prepare and mix 100mL of chloroplatinic acid that contains 1g of Hydrogen
Hexachloroplatinic Hydrate, 0.01g of Lead(II) Acetate Trihydrate and 0.25mL of Hydrochloric Acid (Sigma-Aldrich)
[49]. We add 1mL of mixed solution to each MEA and then electroplate utilizing a Keithley 6221 current source to
supply a DC current of density 4 nA/μm2

, with the ground electrode being anode and all other electrodes being

cathode.
6.2 Neuronal culture preparation
The functionality and versatility of our system and MEA are demonstrated through the recordings from a range of
in-vitro neuronal cultures. This subsection presents the materials and protocols used to prepare each type of culture.
Embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons: For the preparation of ESC-MNs, we culture optogenetic mouse ESC
cell line ChR2H134R-HBG3 Hb9-GFP following an established protocol [59]. Briefly, mESCs are first cultured on a
feeder layer of CF-1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Gibco), then the mESCs are suspended in an induction medium
(advanced DMEM/F-12 and Neurobasal media with 10% KnockOut serum replacement, 1% L-glutamine and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin) in a low-adhesion cell culture dish for two days to allow for the spontaneous formation of
embryoid bodies (EBs). The EBs are then suspended in a differentiation medium (induction medium supplemented
with 2% B-27, 1% N-2, 1% insulin transferrin selenium, 1μM retinoic acid and 1μM smoothened agonist) for up to 5
days. GFP expression is monitored daily to confirm the differentiation into motor neurons. After differentiation, the
EBs are dissociated using Accutase and the resulting single-cell suspension is seeded on the MEAs at a density of
5000/mm2

, following the seeding protocol detailed below. The neurons are kept in maintenance media (Neurobasal
plus media with 2% B-27 plus, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin). In the first 4 days after seeding,
maintenance medium is supplemented with growth factors (BDNF, GDNF, CNTF, NT-3, Forskolin, IBMX) to
promote neurite outgrowth and cell viability [60].
Primary neurons: Primary hippocampal neurons are dissected from time-pregnant rats at E18-E19, and put in
MilliQ water (pH 7.4, 4◦C) supplemented with 1.16% Na2SO4, 0.52% K2SO4, 0.24% HEPES, 0.18% D-glucose and
0.1% MgCl2·6H2O. Hippocampal neurons are further dissociated and kept in MEM Eagle’s with Earles’s BSS w/o
L-glutamine supplemented with glucose, 100mM sodium pyruvate, 200mM L-glutamine, and 100U/mL penicillin
and streptomycin. Seeding and subsequent culture maintenance are similarly performed as for ESC-MNs.
Seeding on MEAs: To prepare the MEAs for culturing dissociated cultures (both ESC-MNs and PNs), MEAs
are first surface-treated using oxygen plasma, followed by an overnight coating of 0.1mg/mL Poly-D-Lysin (PDL)
(Gibco) at room temperature. After the PDL solution is removed, the MEAs are washed with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and allowed to air dry completely. MEAs are then incubated with 20μg/mL laminin solution (Sigma
Aldrich) at room temperature overnight, and the coating solution is removed right before cell seeding without
air-drying.
Organotypic brain slices: Following an established protocol[61], brains from postnatal day 5 rats are sliced into
400μm slices containing somatosensory cortex. Slices are then incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2 at 37◦C in the culture medium, which consists of 2:4 Minimum Essential Medium, 1:4 Hank’s Balanced Salt
