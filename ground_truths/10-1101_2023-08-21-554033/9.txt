Figure 4: 2D neural systems. (a) Fluorescence microscopic image of eGFP ESC-MNs seeded on MEA. (b) Raster plot shows the spontaneous
neural activity recorded from a rectangular MEA layout (Fig. 3b) of 30μm-electrode on day 17 after seeding. Three seconds of filtered data from a
representative channel reveal individual spikes as well as a burst event. Filtering is performed using a third-order bandpass Butterworth filter
with cutting frequencies at 200 and 3000Hz. Spikes are overlaid after sorting. (c) Averaged firing rates across all channels over 2 minutes, as a
function of days after seeding. Results from MEA chips of 30 and 5μm electrodes are reported. Error bars indicate standard deviation across
channels. (d) Averaged firing rate of each recording channel on day 17. The dataset is used to calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defined
as the ratio between the mean spike peak amplitude and the standard deviation of the full signal. (e) Spatial activity propagation in response
to localized electrical stimulation, at two different stimulation sites (top and bottom) and with two different intensities (700mV, 1500mV). Each
stimulation experiment entails 6 to 8 trains of 20Hz biphasic stimulation pulses, with each train lasting for 1 second. Biphasic pulses present a
positive-to-negative transition, where each phase has a duration of 400μs. These parameters are selected based on [52]. Data are recorded from the
30μm MEA of Fig. 3b, on day 17 for the 700mV tests and on day 19 for the 1500mV test. (f) ESC-MNs cultured on a 4-well MEA. Spontaneous
activity is recorded (left raster plot) and channel-wise correlation coefficients are computed to demonstrate separation between different clusters. We
then proceed with selective optical stimulation of well #3. Stimulation lasts 1min with a 1s pulse train delivered every 5s. Each train is comprised
of pulses at 40Hz, 20% duty cycle and 1A current amplitude. The experiment is performed on day 13 using a 465nm LED source acquired from
Doric Lenses. (g) Long-term recording for 24 hours. Box plot shows the spontaneous activity recorded for the first 12mins of every hour. The red
dash denotes the median value, the box indicates the range from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3), and the vertical line extends from
the box by 1.5 times of the inter-quartile range (IQR = Q3 − Q1). Outliers beyond the range of the vertical line are not plotted.
outside the incubation chamber. It should further be noticed that in case of failure, financial losses are minimized
given our system’s low-cost. We then demonstrate the continuous monitoring of ESC-MNs cultures over 24 hours.
As illustrated in Fig. 4g, an overall consistent level of spontaneous neural activity is observed, showing no sign of
either hardware or culture-wise degradation throughout the recording. We also note that prolonged recordings
inevitably produce high volumes of data (in the TB range), rendering post-processing via standard PC workstations
cumbersome and time-consuming. This motivates the extension of our software to include functionalities for
streamlining large-scale post analysis through cloud storage and HPC. Results in Fig. 4g are obtained by deploying
