Figure 5: Higher dimensional neural systems. (a) Platform integration with an add-on fluidic interface module for brain slice recordings. The
add-on module is made of bio-compatible stereolithography material using a Formlabs 3D printer. Before the experiment, the printed parts are
autoclaved and sanitized to ensure nontoxicity to the brain tissue. Hypodermic needles used for fluid flow are grounded to the recording system
to minimize noise levels. (b) Microscopic images of organotypic brain slices placed on curved MEAs with either 30 or 5μm electrode diameters.
Electrodes are arranged to match the curvature of the cortex region, which is the shaded area around the center of the slice. (c) Spike raster
of spontaneous tissue activity, measured around 10mins after transferring onto the MEA. A raster plot corresponding to electrically stimulated
activity, measured around 15mins after transferring, is also reported. Each red dashed line indicates a single biphasic pulse (applied at the bottom
stimulation site). Snapshots of filtered neuronal signals during spontaneous recording showcasing single-unit and multi-unit activities. Cutouts are
plotted to demonstrate the detection of characteristic spike shapes. (d) Firing heatmaps of spontaneous and stimulated activities. (e) 3D engineered
neural tissue mimics (NTMs) made of cell-ECM mixture. Custom multi-well MEA hosts PDMS molds of 4 different shapes, demonstrated in various
controlled NTMs geometries. GFP signals illustrate motor neurons distribution within each tissue. (f) Spontaneous activity recorded on day 7,
from an NTM sample seeded on a 128-electrode, rectangular MEA. (g) Engineered neural spheroids. Microscopic images are taken to visualize
free-floating spheroids and after transferring onto a commercial MEA (used here to confirm cross compatibility with our platform). (h) Spontaneous
activity recorded from the same sample.
