Figure 3: MEA-chips fabrication, design, and characterization. (a) Overview of the MEA fabrication process using cleanroom techniques.
(b) Custom MEA designs of variable capacity (59, 128, 256 and 512 electrodes). Electrodes are 30μm in diameter. The 59-electrode version
replicates the design of the widely employed commercial Multichannel System 60MEA200/30 series. (c) Three 128-channel MEA designs with
customized topologies. The curved layout presents a curvature of ∼0.35mm−1

, matching the typical morphology of mouse cerebral cortex [46].
The perturbed layout entails random electrode displacements of up to 50μm from the standard, rectangular layout of (b). (d) Platinum black
deposition reduces electrodes impedance. Microscopic images are taken after deposition for both 30μm and 5μm electrodes. Close-ups illustrate the
granular structure that Pt forms on the electrode. (e) Impedance magnitude before and after Pt deposition across electrodes of different sizes. (f)
Time-deposition dependent impedance magnitude reduction. (g) Time-deposition dependent change in impedance phase.
Comparison with alternatives and cost breakdown. With all major specifications illustrated, we summarize
and compare our in vitro electrophysiology approach with other previously reported custom solutions. As illustrated
in Fig. 2, from a recording system perspective our approach demonstrates the highest level of versatility, while
being fully committed to open-sourcing both hardware and software. Further, and importantly, the robustness and
utility of our system is comprehensively demonstrated across a range of neural substrates and stimulation settings,
long-term and off-site recordings, as well as through extensions such as fluidic circulation and concurrent imaging.
A cost estimate is also provided. Incorporating open-source components as well as inexpensive, accessible
materials, our platforms can be assembled at a fraction of the investment necessary for a comparable commercial
product. Indeed, our platforms range from approximately ∼ $2,500 for a 59-channel system to ∼ $12,000 for a
512-channel device (both including the Open Ephys terminal), delivering ∼10-25X cost reductions, depending on
vendor and comparative specifications. Given the modularity of our approach, this price advantage becomes even
more significant considering that a single fabricated system can be reconfigured to satisfy a number of different or
evolving needs. Details of the cost breakdown can be found in SI.
Finally, we emphasize that all CAD designs, manufacturing and assembly instructions, software and user
documentation are made available with links to permanent repositories (Material and Methods and SI).
