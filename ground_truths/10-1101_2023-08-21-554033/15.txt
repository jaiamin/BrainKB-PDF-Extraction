Solution, 1:4 Horse Serum, 4mM glutamine and 1:100 penicillin/streptomycin. Half of the medium is replaced every
3 days. Two weeks after slice preparation, slices are removed from the incubator and placed on the curved MEA for
recording. During recording, oxygenated culture medium is pumped into and out of the MEA well via a peristaltic
pump (see SI). An inline heater is placed immediately before the well to warm the medium to 37◦C. Both prior to
and after each experiment, distilled water and isopropyl alcohol are run through the entire fluid line to clean them
of any biological debris.
6.3 Calcium imaging
Loading calcium indicator : Calcium imaging is performed by first loading the neuronal culture with a cell permeable
fluorescent calcium indicator, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 (AAT Bioquest). To do this, the calcium indicator is
diluted in the neural maintenance medium at a final concentration of 4μM, and then supplied to the culture to
replace the old medium. Subsequently, the culture is incubated for 40mins in a humidified environment with 5%
CO2 at 37◦C. Right before the measurement, the culture is washed twice with PBS and supplied with fresh medium.
Fluorescence intensity measurement: Spontaneous calcium activity is acquired by employing a fluorescent microscope
(Nikon Eclipse Ti) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter with excitation/emission wavelength of 490/525nm.
Recording is conducted under a 488nm laser illumination and at an original frame rate of 100fps. We then
down-sample the recorded video to measure the fluorescence intensity using the open-source software ImageJ. The
variation of the fluorescence intensity is defined through the normalized form as ∆F/F0=(F-F0)/F0, where F and
F0 are the instantaneous and initial fluorescence intensity, respectively.
