detect endogenous Pdlim5 via immunofluorescence (Figure 1A). A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against Pdlim5
(#38–8800) was used for both blot and immunofluorescence (IF) assays. Primary rabbit IgG from Life Technologies
(#10500C) was used for negative-control “IPs”, as was mouse IgG from Invitrogen (#10400C). (Figure 3A, S3A, S3B, S3C).
To detect endogenous PalmD in immunofluorescence assays, we employed a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ProteinTech,
catalog # 16531-1-AP) (Figure3A and S3A). delta-Catenin was visualized using a mouse monoclonal antibody (BD
Transduction Laboratories catalog # 611537, not shown). All HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal secondary antibodies were
obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (anti-mouse #31430 and anti-rabbit #31460). All Alexa fluor immunofluorescent

secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (488 anti-mouse #A32723, 488 anti-rabbit #A22008, 555 anti-
mouse #A21422, 555 anti-rabbit #A32732 and 555 anti-chicken A32932).

Golgi Localization Sequence Assay (GLS)
Immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22) were cultured in DMEM cell culture media (Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). Transfections of cells
were done at 50%-to-60% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000. Golgi co-relocalization was examined by fixation with
4% PFA 24 hours after transfection, followed by immunostaining and subsequent image collection using confocal
microscopy. To ectopically relocalize Pdlim5 to the Golgi, Pdlim5 was tagged at its’ N-terminus with the Golgi localization
sequence (GLS) of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 7

. Following co-transfection with one of Pdlim5’s putative
partners (e.g., PalmD), the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining as previously described 7,44. Qualitative
analysis involved visual examination of co-relocalized partner proteins to the Golgi, occurring only when GLS-Pdlim5 is
present. Quantitative analysis involved measuring the average fluorescence intensity of the Golgi body compared to that
of the cytosol in each optical channel using ImageJ. This comparison generated a Golgi:cytosolic intensity ratio for each
condition.

Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)
To perform Proximity Ligation Assays (PLA), neurons were fixed at 4 days in vitro (DIV4) with 4% PFA and the Duolink
PLA kit was employed as previously described 7 following the manufacturer's (Sigma-Aldrich) protocol 45.
In brief, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 and blocked with 1% BSA blocking solution. Neurons were then
incubated with primary antibodies specific to each of the two endogenous target proteins, such as Pdlim5 and PalmD.
Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Duolink PLA probes. These probes recognize the
primary antibodies and enable the generation of a DNA structure recognized by manufacturer-provided fluorescent
probes. To generate the DNA structure, the cells were incubated with a ligase and amplification enzymes. Finally, the
permeabilized and blocked cells were incubated with the fluorescent probes and imaged using a Nikon T2i Inverted
Confocal Microscope equipped with an Apo-Plan 60× 1.4 NA oil objective. The imaging was conducted at a pixel size of
100 nm, and image stacks were converted into maximum projection images for analysis. The quantification of puncta
was performed using the Puncta Analyzer plugin within the ImageJ software.
Co-immunoprecipitations and immunoblots
For immunoblot assay of endogenous proteins from rat primary cortical neurons, 2 x 106 cells from six 10 cm dishes
were collected and lysed at DIV9. For immunoblotting assays of exogenous co-immunoprecipitated proteins, HEK293
cells were lysed 24-to-48 hours following their co-transfection, using established protocols 7

. In brief, following lysis and
pelleting of debris, protein concentrations of lysates were equalized (500-1000 μg per condition/ IP) and incubated with
primary antibodies for 2-to-12 hours at 4°C with gentle rotation. Protein-A and Protein-G Dynabeads (Invitrogen,
#10002D and #10004D) were added to each tube and incubated for an additional 20-30 min with gentle rotation at 4°C.
After washing, the associated proteins were eluted from the beads upon addition of 2× sample buffer with βME and
heated at 95°C for 5 min. Co-IP samples, or in the case of whole-cell extracts equalized cell lysates, were then loaded
onto 10% polyacrylamide gels using a BioRad mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cells, 2-gel system setup (#1658005) and run for 120
