Fig. 3. The neural envelope tracking (NET) correlations and spectral entropy (SE) on Dataset I and Dataset II. The
NET correlation is significantly higher when actively listening (‘Audio’) than when passively listening during the
movie watching (‘Movie’), arithmetic exercise solving (‘Mathematics’) and text reading (‘Text’) distractor conditions.
Contrarily, the SE in a network of frontal, parietal-occipital and occipital channels on a frequency range spanning the
alpha and beta bands is significantly lower when actively listening than when passively listening during a distractor
condition. This experiment has been repeated for window lengths of 10 s and 30 s. Red and blue dots represent the
individual data points, whereas the black dots represent the data points per subject averaged across windows and folds.
Lines connect the per-subject averages and p-values are noted on the right of the data.
increases when evaluating on a reduced portion of high NET correlation segments.
However, the sAAD accuracy decreases when evaluating on a reduced portion of low SE
segments.

As the SE characterises the uncertainty in distribution on a network of frontal, parietal-
occipital and occipital channels on a frequency range spanning the alpha and beta bands,

our hypothesis is that the SE does not detect the absolute auditory attention, but rather
reflects the differences in cognitive resources spent on each task (either active listening or
a distractor condition). Indeed, in Dataset I and Dataset II, the passive listening conditions
are all coupled to specific distractor conditions (movie watching, arithmetic exercise
solving and text reading) that require mental resources. The relation for SE between
active and passive listening, consequently, seems to depend on the specific distractor
task, reducing its relevance as a generic feature for absolute auditory attention detection.
