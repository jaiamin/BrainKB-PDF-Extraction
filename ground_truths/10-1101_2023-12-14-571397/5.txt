Let y(t) represent the target speech envelope at sample time t, and xc(t) the sample
of the c-th EEG channel at sample time t. The goal is to reconstruct the T subsequent

At validation time, this decoder is applied to the validation data that were held out

, computed over Tv samples, is hypothesised to be higher when
actively listening [11]. Therefore, we use this stimulus correlation as a first feature to
discriminate between active and passive listening. As per [11], the Spearman correlation
coefficient, a rank-ordered Pearson correlation, is used in this work [19].
B. Spectral entropy

SE is a measure for the uncertainty of a random variable by characterising the peaked-
ness of the probability density function [20]. Herein, large SE values map to high

uncertainty and hence lower predictability. Since power spectral densities (PSDs) after
normalisation are non-negative and sum to one like probability density functions, the
SE can also be applied to these normalised PSDs in the frequency domain in order to
describe the peakedness of these PSDs [14], [16]. This so-called SE can be hypothesised
to be used to leverage spectral differences, where higher SE levels correspond to less
predictability in the neural response. Let Pxc

(f) ∈ R represent the normalised PSD
