Fig. 4. Classification accuracies of the absolute auditory attention detection (aAAD) task on Dataset I and Dataset
II using the neural envelope tracking (NET) correlations and the spectral entropy (SE). The mean accuracy across
the subjects is marked in bold and the standard deviation is shown as shading. On both datasets, the methods yield
accuracies above chance level.

Fig. 5. Selective auditory attention decoding (sAAD) accuracies on the x%, x = 0, . . . , 100, highest active listening
segments, as signalled by the highest neural envelope tracking (NET) correlation and lowest spectral entropy (SE)
segments conform the findings on Dataset I and Dataset II. By selecting the highest NET correlation segments and
only evaluating sAAD performance on these segments, the sAAD accuracy increases with a decreasing proportion of
the validation set used, whereas the reverse is observed when selecting low SE segments. This trend is present for all
the 10 s, 30 s and 60 s window lengths.
Nevertheless, the SE does prove useful in discriminating between two distinct, predefined
tasks (e.g., active listening versus watching a movie) whenever both tasks require a
different amount of cognitive resources. However, the relative change of the SE between
two conditions will depend on the nature of the task(s) in both conditions, and is not
necessarily (directly) related to the state of active versus passive listening. This hypothesis
is, furthermore, consistent with the predictive power of the SE in dedicated tasks, such
as for anaesthetic depth [14], [15], respiration movements [15], sleep stages [15], and
imagined finger movement [15], and consistent with the discriminative power in dedicated
tasks, such as between subjects in rest and subjects performing mental arithmetic [16],
and between subjects in rest and subjects fixated on flashing patterns [17]. The NET
