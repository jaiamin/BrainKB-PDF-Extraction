Fig. 1. Overview of absolute auditory attention detection (aAAD), selective auditory attention decoding (sAAD) and
their combination. (a) In aAAD, the subject is attending a single auditory stimulus, either in a state of attention or
inattention to the speech (i.e., active or passive listening). At training time, data from these two conditions are leveraged
to train the features and classifiers. At validation time, these are used to assess whether the subject is actively listening
or not. (b) Contrarily, in sAAD, multiple auditory stimuli are simultaneously present at each given moment. At training
time, the data are again leveraged to train the features and classifiers. At validation time, however, the sAAD features
and classifiers are used to discriminate to which stimulus the subject is attending. (c) Both setups can be combined,
where the sAAD performance is evaluated only on segments where active listening is signalled, removing segments
of auditory inattention.

II. ABSOLUTE AUDITORY ATTENTION DETECTION

To detect whether a subject is in a state of active listening, i.e., perform aAAD, we
will extract two features from the EEG:
1) Neural envelope tracking (NET): In the presence of a speech stimulus, the neural
response tracks certain characteristics of that speech stimulus, such as its envelope,
i.e., the slow variations over time [1], [6]–[8], [13]. This envelope tracking is
hypothesised to be more strongly present when the subject is more attentive to
the speech [1], [11].
2) Spectral entropy (SE): Different tasks or conditions result in different neural
activity across the brain [4], [13], [14], [16]–[18]. These differences in neural
activity can, e.g., be quantified using the SE of the EEG recorded at a particular
scalp location. The SE is hypothesised to quantify the predictability or regularity
in the EEG activity, as will be detailed infra [13]–[17]. In [13], it was hypothesised
that the SE is higher in active listening compared to passive listening conditions.
The NET feature is discussed first, and the SE feature thereafter.
A. Neural envelope tracking

To evaluate the degree of envelope tracking, a decoder consisting of a linear spatio-
temporal filter is applied to the EEG signals to reconstruct the envelope of the speech

stimulus. This is commonly achieved by minimising the squared error between the
original and reconstructed speech envelope [1], [2], [11]. The degree of envelope tracking
can subsequently be assessed by computing the correlation coefficient ρ(.) between the
reconstructed and ground truth envelope.
