The assumption of a Gaussian measurement model turns Eq. (S18) into the ratio between the variance of the
posterior and the variance of the likelihood
sˆ
′
(x) = variance of posterior for outcome x

variance of likelihood (S19)

as also follows from Eq. (S10) evaluated with n = 1.
Because this derivative is in principle measurable from experiments that probe the perceived utility curve, its range
of values may offer a further experimental test for the theory. Obviously it can never be equal to zero, because the
numerator of Eq. (S19) vanishes only if the observations are completely uninformative or the prior itself has zero
variance. This marks a difference between the theory presented here and the power-law ansatz seen in [7], where this
derivative vanishes in the origin.
Under the assumptions of Sec. S-II D, it can be seen that the ratio (S19) is always subunity at x = 0. To prove
that, it is sufficient to restate the main result of Sec. S-II D as sˆ(x)

x < 1. Since under the same conditions sˆ(0) = 0, we

find

F. Asymptotics of the posterior mean

The asymptotics of the posterior mean has asymptotic scaling contained between O(1) and O(x) in the limit of
large outcomes (x → ∞).
To see this, begin by noticing that the posterior mean is a nondecreasing function of the outcome x. From this, it
follows that no scaling below O(1) is possible.
On the other hand, suppose the scaling was larger than O(x). It would then be possible to find a sufficiently large
value x∗, such that for x > x∗ the inequality ⟨s⟩ ≥ x is violated. Since this inequality was proven in Sec. S-II D, it
follows that ( under the same conditions given in that section) the large-x scaling of sˆ(x) is linear at most.

G. Compact-support priors and posterior mean

A preliminary step to prove the open-mind theorem is to study the asymptotic behavior of the posterior mean for
compact-support priors.
In the following we consider the limit x → ∞ for convenience, although the same considerations apply to the limit
x → −∞. We prove that the two statements of sˆ(x) having a finite limit for large x and the prior having compact
support are equivalent, as long as ρ ∈ C

0 and σ < ∞.

We start from the assumption that the prior has compact support. The set of points {s : ρ(s) > 0} has therefore
a supremum S < ∞, and from the definition of sˆ(x) it follows sˆ(x) < S ∀x, entailing that the large-x limit of sˆ(x) is
finite.
Vice versa, to prove that a finite limit entails a compact support, we suppose ad absurdum that the support is not
compact. It follows that for every L ∈ R we can find an increasing sequence s1 < s2 < . . . such that L < s1 and
ρ(si) > 0 ∀i ≥ 1. Since ρ ∈ C
0
, we also have that ρ(s) is positive in a neighborhood of each si
.
The statement being true for any L, it holds in particular for L = limx→∞ sˆ(x). We write therefore

sˆ(x) = ⟨s⟩
[−∞,s1]
s|x w(−∞, s1|x) + ⟨s⟩
[s1,∞]
s|x w(s1, ∞|x) (S21)
