ρ(s|(x, σ), H1) ̸= ρ(s|H1) (7)

The posterior distribution of s has a form similar to the prior:
ρ(s|(x, σ)) = p1δ(s − s0) + (1 − p1)gγ1

(s − s1) (8)
where p1, γ1, and s1 are updated values of parameters that depend on the parameters of the prior as well as on the
observation. In particular, p1 = P(H0|(x, σ)) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H0:

p1 =
1
1 + K−1

where

K =

Since the location of the spike is constant, in general the location of the spike and Gaussian slab in the posterior do
not coincide (s1 ̸= s0).

B. Single adjustment step

Let us first assume that just a single adjustment step has been made–a likely scenario when faced with very limited
time. After the adjustment step the posterior has been calculated, but what value should be used to compare options
and take a decision? Let us denote the point estimator used for decision-making to compare options as sˆ. If the
observation confirms the anchor (x = s0), the optimal estimator should remain the anchor, so we must have sˆ(0) = s0.
On the other hand, any difference between sˆ and x must clearly come from a bias in the prior distribution ρ0(s), and
in the limit where the prior is very flat (p0 → 0), we must have the asymptotic behavior sˆ ≈ x.
These requirements are satisfied by a wide range of estimators and many results presented in this work should
extend to other such estimators. For concreteness, in the following we choose the minimum mean squared error
estimator, which amounts to calculating the expectation sˆ = ⟨s|x⟩ over the posterior distribution. Measuring the
argument of the estimator by its displacement from the anchor, we define sˆ(x − s0; s0) := ⟨s|x⟩, and will omit explicit
mention of the anchor as the second argument of sˆ where obvious. The explicit expression for sˆ reads

sˆ = s0 +
1
1 + K
γ

σ

(x − s0). (14)
Note that, due to the dependence on the Bayes factor K, sˆ is a nonlinear function of x − s0. This nonlinearity will be
essential when we discuss the role of anchoring-with-adjustment in the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes (Section V).
