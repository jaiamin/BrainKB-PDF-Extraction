where the second term represents the mean-value shift from measurement due to the prior’s traction, expressed
compactly via the differential formulation of a Weierstrass transform [40].
As seen from (S5), antisymmetry of sˆ(x) implies antisymmetry of the second term on the RHS, hence symmetry
of the function subjected to ∂x. Log being bijective on R

+, that entails in turn symmetry of the argument of the
logarithm, that is, of the Weierstrass transform of the prior. But the Weierstrass transforms commute with the parity
operator, from which we infer symmetry of the prior itself.

B. Gaussian identities

For some of the following manipulations it will be useful to recall, as a preliminary, that the product of two Gaussian
densities can be written as
Gμ1,σ1
(s)Gμ2,σ2
(s) = G0,

So if the prior is Gaussian with zero-mean and variance γ

, applying (S6) with σ1 = σ and σ2 = γ we see that the

resulting normalization prefactor is gΣ(0), where we are establishing the notation Σ
2 = γ

, and the normalized

posterior distribution is φ(s|x) = Gsˆ(x),Γ(s) with the posterior variance

(S9)
which is linear in x. In particular, it will be useful to remember that the posterior mean is O(x) for large x whereas
the variance is O(1).

C. Connection between perceived utility and posterior cumulants

We are going to prove the statement that

We will prove relationship (S10) by induction. For n = 0, (S10) reduces to sˆ(x) = ⟨s⟩s|x and therefore is true.
Assume that Eq. (S10) is verified for n − 1. We write then its LHS for n as
