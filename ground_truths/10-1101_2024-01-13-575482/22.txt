This indeed has a single zero at the half-point (q = 1). As seen from the only part of the numerator that changes
sign, at that point the functions turns from negative to positive if r > 0, so it is indeed an increasing function of q
there (and a decreasing one if r < 0) as desired.
All of the above formula also hold true in the limit δ → 0, where one of the two gaussians becomes a delta function
and the spike-and-slab results are recovered with p0 = α.

S-V. GENERAL RESULTS
A. Posterior mean vanishes for zero deviations

The reflection effect is, in our framework, the fact that the perceived utility U(p, r) gets positive for sufficiently
large p if r is negative, and gets negative for sufficiently large p if r is positive. From that fact, we infer in particular
the inequalities

U(p = 1, r > 0) ≥ 0 (S53)
U(p = 1, r < 0) ≤ 0 (S54)
On the other hand, from the definition of U(p, r) we see that U(p = 1, r) is always equal to ⟨s⟩0 regardless of the
sign of r. So the only way to satisfy both inequalities is if ⟨s⟩0 = 0.
That’s of course automatically satisfied if the prior is symmetric around zero. But as seen here, it has to be true
also for asymmetric priors.

B. Gaussian prior generates rational preferences

Eq. (S9) shows that the posterior mean is linear in the measurement.
Plugging that linear law into Eq. (S32), we find

U(q, r) ≡ 0 (S55)

for any value of q and for any value of r, as shown in Fig. 5.

The finding is therefore that U is a measure of nongaussianity – or, in other words,the Kahneman-Tversky experi-
ment itself measures the nongaussianity of the prior. If the prior was Gaussian, experimental subjects would choose
