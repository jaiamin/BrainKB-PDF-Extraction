where ρ(s) being positive in a right neighborhood of s = s1 results in w(M, ∞|x) > 0 .
Given that formula (S22) is an average over the interval [a, b] with the distribution
ψ(s; a, b) = ρ(s)gσ(s − x)θ(s − a)θ(b − s)

R b

ds ρ(s)gσ(s − x)

(S24)

it follows that

⟨s⟩
[s1,∞]
s|x ≥ ⟨s⟩
[−∞,s1]
s|x

(S25)

Let us now find bounds for the weights w’s. We note that

w(−∞, s1|x) ≤
 Z M
−∞
ρ(s)ds
sups∈(−∞,s1)

gσ(s − x) = gσ(s1 − x)
Z M
−∞
ρ(s)ds (S26)
where the last equality holds for sufficiently large x (x ≥ s1). We also note that there is a right neighborhood of s2
with size δ where ρ(s) > 0, hence

w(s1, ∞|x) ≥
R ∞
s2
ds ρ(s)gσ(s − x)

gσ(s2 − x)
R ∞

ds ρ(s)

R ∞
−∞ ds ρ(s)gσ(s − x)

(S27)

where the second inequality holds for sufficiently large x (x ≥ s2).
From Eqs. (S26) and (S27), it follows that

limx→∞
w(−∞, s1|x)
w(s1, ∞|x)
≤
R s1
−∞ ρ(s)ds
R ∞
s2
ρ(s)ds
limx→∞
gσ(s1 − x)
gσ(s2 − x)
= 0 (S28)
On the other hand, for any x we have w(−∞, s1|x) + w(s1, ∞|x) = 1, which together with Eq. (S28) yields

limx→∞
w(−∞, s1|x) = 0 limx→∞

w(s1, ∞|x) = 1 (S29)

Applying (S28) and Eq. (S25) into Eq. (S21), we obtain

limx→∞
sˆ(x) = limx→∞
⟨s⟩
[s1,∞]
s|x w(s1, ∞|x) = limx→∞
⟨s⟩
[s1,∞]
s|x

(S30)

On the other hand, from Eq. (S22) we have ⟨s⟩
[s1,∞]
s|x ≥ s1 > L, so we reach the contradictory conclusion that

limx→∞ sˆ(x) > L, which shows that a finite limit L cannot exist.

S-III. DEFINITION OF THE PERCEIVED UTILITY FUNCTION

The experimental setting used to verify the Reflection Effect [5] is described by Table I of the main text. The
function that determines the perceived utility given a certain outcome is sˆ(x) = ⟨s⟩x. This function must be averaged
over all outcomes to yield the actual value of the perceived utility U associated to any choice.
Therefore, the perceived utility becomes

U(p, r) = UA(p, r) − UB(p, r) = psˆ(r/p − r) + (1 − p)ˆs(−r) (S31)

and is written most concisely in terms of the odds q =
1−p
p
