(S63)

which doesn’t need to be true for any pair of values r and r
′
, and is only required to hold true in the limit r
′ ≫ r.

Now, because we already know that f has to be asymptotically linear, calling its asymptote sˆ(r) ∼ sˆ
′
(∞)x, we can

write this as

sˆ

(∞) > sˆ(r)/r ∀r (S64)

or, given the continuity of the curve

E. Restating the two tangent inequalities
The tangent inequalities, shown graphically in Fig. S1, can be collected in the form

sˆ
′
(0) <
sˆ(r)
r
< sˆ
′
(∞) (S66)

Obviously, requiring sˆ
′
(r) to be monotonically increasing would be sufficient to ensure this. But it would also be
overdemanding. The ratio sˆ(r)/r can range widely over the real axis as long as it never becomes smaller than its
zero-deviation value, or larger than the asymptotic slope.
Notice that, applying (S10) with n = 1, we can rewrite the tangent inequalities as

Var(s|x = 0)
σ
2
<
⟨s⟩x
x
<
Var(s|x → ∞)
σ
2

(S67)
which are direct constraints on the posterior distribution. The next question to tackle is therefore what constraints
on the prior are posed by such constraints on the posterior.

F. Second derivative vanishes for zero-deviation outcome

The forbidden-region rules derived above teach us something about the derivatives of sˆ(x) in the origin. To see
this, notice that the inequalities (S59) must apply also for infinitesimally small |r|. In other words, we must have

sˆ(r) = ˆs(0) + ˆs
′
(0)r +
1
2
sˆ
′′(0)r
2 + o(r
2
)
(
> sˆ
′
(0)r if r > 0
< sˆ
′
(0)r if r < 0

(S68)

Now, we showed in Sec. S-V A that sˆ(0) = 0. Ad absurdum suppose sˆ

′′(0) is different from zero. Then it becomes
the dominant term in these inequalities near the origin, because everything else is zero or cancels out. The tangent
inequalities require then the second derivative to be at the same time nonnegative and nonpositive, so it must vanish.
The leading term is therefore the one of order r

3 or higher. Applying Eq. (S10) with n = 2, notice that the vanishing
of the second derivative is equivalent to the vanishing of the skewness of the posterior in the particular case of outcome
r = 0.
