indifferently among options with any risk level. Thus, the "linearity in probability" that prospect theory problematizes
proves to be here something more familiar – normality of prior distributions.
In fact, a normal distribution is the only choice of a prior that would annihilate the perceived utility – as we proceed
to prove.
Imposing Eq. (S55) for all (q, r) enforces ⟨s⟩ax = a⟨s⟩x for all a ≤ 0. This in turn entails the same equality ∀a > 0
as well (just apply it twice with a1 = a2 = −
√
a). For a one-dimensional argument x, this scaling law implies linearity.
If the posterior mean has no x-derivatives beyond the first, Eq. (S10) implies that the posterior distribution has no
cumulants beyond the second one, i.e. it is normal.
Gaussianity of the prior follows immediately through (2).

C. First tangent inequality

The derivative of the perceived utility is

∂pU = ˆs(r/p − r) − sˆ(−r) − rsˆ
′
(r/p − r)/p (S56)

where sˆ(x) = ⟨s⟩x; or in terms of the odds
∂qU =
rsˆ
′
(qr) + ˆs(−r)
1 + q
+
−qsˆ(−r) − sˆ(qr)
(1 + q)
2

(S57)
Because U must have the opposite sign to r in a left neighborhood of p = 1 (or right neighborhood of q = 0), where
it touches zero, it follows that the derivative at that point is of particular importance. From (S57), we see that

[∂qU]q=0 = rsˆ
′
(0) + ˆs(−r) (S58)
Now, to comply with the reflection effect this must be negative for gains and positive for losses which finally leads
to

sˆ(r) > sˆ
′
(0)r if r > 0 (S59)
sˆ(r) < sˆ
′
(0)r if r < 0 (S60)
I will refer to these inequalities as "tangent inequalities" because they state that the curve must lie above its
zero-deviation tangent.
The tangent inequalities are related to the concave-convex shape described in [7]. Since in that theory sˆ(0) = 0, a
second derivative sˆ

′′(x) that has everywhere the same sign as x is a sufficient condition for the forbidden regions to
stay untouched. However, it is in general not a necessary condition. The graph of sˆ(x) can fluctuate without harm,
changing the sign of all its derivatives, as long as it never enters a forbidden wedge of the Cartesian plane – located
beneath the curve in the upper right quadrant, and above the curve in the lower left quadrant.
One consequence of this has to do with the behavior at infinity. Namely, if the asymptotic behavior of sˆ(x) is linear
sˆ(x) = βx + o(x), we must have necessarily β ≥ sˆ
′
(0) and, if β = ˆs
′
(0), a strictly positive subleading contribution in

the remainder.

D. Second tangent inequality

The above inequalities are a lower bound on sˆ(r)/r. Similarly, we also have an upper bound on sˆ(r)/r. We will
write down the derivation briefly. For large q, we can write
U ∼ sˆ(−r) + 1
q
sˆ(qr) (S61)
With a symmetric prior, sˆ(x) is antisymmetric, and U > 0 can be written as sˆ(qr) > −qsˆ(−r) = qsˆ(r) which in
turn can be rearranged (setting r

′ = qr) into
sˆ(r
′
) > sˆ(r) + sˆ(r)
r
(r
′ − r) (S62)
