Figure 4. Bias and root-mean-square error as functions of the number of adjustment steps. If reanchoring sets s1 (and s0 in
the spike) to the posterior mean sˆ, the anchor-induced bias persist for many steps (top panels). In contrast, if s1 is used for
reanchoring, the bias is reduced rapidly (bottom panels). Completely rational behavior corresponds to zero bias as the two
options to chose from have the same expected value. The right-hand panels show that the root-mean-square error decreases
as a function of the number of adjustment steps. This provides a principled explanation to the experimental finding, reported
by [15], that fluctuations shrins as a function of the number of steps. Simulation parameters: bias σ = 1, p0 = 0.9, s0 = 0, #
of samples: 104
