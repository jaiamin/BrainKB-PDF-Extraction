(S32)
The case of a risk-free outcome is recovered for q = 0, when indeed we have UA = UB and thus U(q, r) = 0.
In the main text we started out by deriving a theory based on a specific cognitive prior (the spike-and-slab prior),
and calculated from it a specific form of the function S32, showing that it leads to experimentally verifiable results.
In this supplement, we would like to proceed the other way around. Namely, we will now make some experimentally
motivated demands on the perceived utility function given in Eq. S32 (which constitutes of course the final output of
our theory) and will asking what cognitive priors would output a perceived utility fulfilling those requirements.
The reflection effect amounts to the requirement that perceived utility U flips sign as a function of the gain/loss
probability p, becoming positive for sufficiently large p if r is negative, and becoming negative for sufficiently large p
if r is positive.
The goal therefore is to characterize the set of prior densities ρ(s) such that:
(A) For any r > 0, the equation U(q, r) = 0 is satisfied for a single q ∈ (0, ∞), let’s call it q+. At q+ the lowest-order
nonvanishing derivative of U with respect to q is positive.
(B) For any r < 0, the equation U(q, r) = 0 is satisfied for a single q ∈ (0, ∞), let’s call it q− . In q−, the lowest-order
nonvanishing derivative of U with respect to q is negative.
The point that makes U vanish will be called in either case the choice-switching point. Experiments suggest that
q+ ≈ q− (reflection principle) and that this is around ≈ 0.2.
Assuming ρ symmetric makes sˆ(x) antisymmetric, and a consequence of that is that conditions (B) are automatically
satisfied if conditions (A) are.

S-IV. PARTICULAR CASES
A. Spike-and-slab prior

Although in this supplement we do not restrict ourselves to the spike-and-slab form of the prior, that specific prior
deserves special attention because it encodes relevant experimental knowledge from anchor-and-adjust heuristic. We
review it briefly in this section.
The spike-and-slab prior already stated in the main text (Eq. 5) is

ρ(s) = p0δ(s) + (1 − p0)gγ(s) (S33)

and leads to a posterior distribution of the form

φ(s) ∝ p0gσ(x)δ(s) + (1 − p0)g√
