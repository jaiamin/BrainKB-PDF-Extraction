was completed, the pipette was left in place for an additional 10 min, and then slowly withdrawn. The skin wound
was then closed with absorbable sutures. Mice were monitored up to 5 days post-operation and administered
Meloxicam 10 mg/kg (once a day for three days) and slow-release Buprenorphine 1 mg/kg (once, administered
after surgery) to minimize pain. We used the following coordinates relative to Bregma: SCN -0.4 mm
anteroposterior (AP), ±0.15 mm mediolateral (ML), -5.8 mm dorsoventral (DV) unilaterally (though achieving
bilateral spread); MRN -4.2 mm AP, 0.0 mm ML, -4.5 mm DV unilaterally; POA +0.14 mm AP, ±0.5 mm ML,
-5.5 mm DV bilaterally; LH -1.58 mm AP, ±1.25 mm ML, -5.0 mm DV bilaterally; Hb -1.34 AP, ± 0.35mm ML,
-2.5mm DV bilaterally. To account for differences in brain size, Bregma-Lambda distance of each experimental
mouse was measured and divided by 4.2 mm (~ Bregma-Lambda distance according to Paxinos Atlas) to calculate
a normalizing factor that was used to scale the anteroposterior coordinate.
Mice showing incorrect viral targeting, or partial coverage of the target area, were excluded from the study.
Viral vectors
The following viral vectors were used: AAVretro-CAG-tdTomato (Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) Viral

Core), 1.2 x 1012 genomic copies (gc)/mL; AAV2-CAG-GFP (BCH Viral Core), 2 x 1012 gc/mL; AAV2-CAG-
tdTomato (BCH Viral Core), 1.8 x 1011

gc/mL; AAVretro-Syn-Cre (Addgene #105553, a gift from James M.
Wilson) 4 x 1012 gc/mL; AAV8-Con-Fon-TVA-mCherry (Addgene plasmid #131779, a gift from Karl
Deisseroth) and AAV5-Con-Fon-oG (Addgene plasmid #131778, a gift from Karl Deisseroth) were custom
packaged by the BCH Viral Core at titers 3.2 x 1013 gc/ml and 2.4 x 1013 gc/ml, respectively; EnvA pseudotyped
G-Deleted Rabies Virus GFP (Salk Institute GT3 Viral Core), 2 x 108

infection units/mL; AAV8-DIO-Flpo

(Addgene #87306-AAV8, a gift from Li Zhang) 2.3 x 1012 gc/mL.
Home cage running-wheel assay
For the duration of the running-wheel experiments, mice of either sex were single housed. Running wheels were
custom built by Ofer Mazor and Pavel Gorelik from the Harvard Medical School Instrumentations Core Facility.
Briefly, metal wheels were mounted on a plexiglass transparent support that fit standard mouse cages. An infrared
sensor was integrated within the plexiglass support to detect the spokes of the wheel passing by (a single
revolution was considered when the two spokes of the wheel passed by the sensor) and connected to a 24-port
Raspberry Pi running a custom-made script for activity detection. Data was expressed as revolutions/second,
visualized and analysed in 10 sec bins using custom R scripts . Sta) and Prism 9 (GraphPad). Mice were allowed
to habituate to the running wheel for at least a week before collecting activity data.
Chronic sleep/wake measurements
Following stereotaxic injection of AAVs, mice were implanted with 2-channel Electroencephalography (EEG)/
1-channel Electromyography (EMG) headmounts (Pinnacle Technology, # 8201-SS). Four screws (front 0.10’’,
#8209; back 0.12’’, #8212, Pinnacle Technology) were inserted into the skull to anchor the headmount and
simultaneously record cortical EEG signals. Two EMG wires positioned in the neck muscle recorded EMG
signals. The headmount was secured using dental cement. Mice recoveredw for 5 days, and then were connected
to the wireless EEG/EMG recording device (Pinnacle Technology, # 8200-K9-SL) for 24 hours (habituation)
before the start of the recording session. Each device (up to 4 simultaneously, to avoid Bluetooth interference as
per manufacturer recommendation) was then paired with a Bluetooth receiver connected via USB to a computer
running the Sirenia data acquisition software (Pinnacle Technology). Baseline sleep/wake was recorded
continuously over the following 2 days, before switching to either short or long photoperiod. Recordings lasted
up to 3 weeks.
Analysis of sleep/wake was performed using Sirenia Sleep Pro (Pinnacle technology). Digitized polygraphic data
were analysed in 10 sec bins, their power spectra generated and then classified as Wake, NREM and REM using
the Cluster Scoring function. Data was then manually curated to either confirm/correct sleep/wake states or to
score unidentified epochs. Sirenia Sleep Pro was used to calculate the amount of Wake/NREM/REM in defined
time periods. Data was visualized using GraphPad Prism 9.
