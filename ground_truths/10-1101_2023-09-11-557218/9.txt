robust TVA-mCherry expression in Cre/Flp-double
positive cells (Extended Data Fig. 8). However,
similar to previous reports 38, we detected some
mCherry in Cre-only cells, likely reflecting leaky
expression from the antisense configuration of the
Cre-recombined transgene; this prevented precise
estimation of the starter cell population. No leaky
expression was detected in Flp-only cells.
Importantly, no trans-synaptic spread of the RV was
detected in wild-type or single-transgenic animals38
.
Using this unbiased, brain-wide approach for
mapping afferents, we identified four major
monosynaptic inputs to mrEn1-Pet1 neurons:
Preoptic Area (POA), Lateral Hypothalamus (LH),
Lateral Habenula (LHb), and Ventral Tegmental

Area (VTA) (Fig. 5c). Three of these regions (POA,
LH, LHb) receive direct input from intrinsically
photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and are known
to influence sleep/wake behaviour as well as
arousal39–42, thus representing possible circuit nodes
capable of transmitting photoperiod information to
mrEn1-Pet1 neurons.
Having delineated afferents to the mrEn1-
Pet1 population as a whole, we next queried which
provide input to the SCN-projecting subset of
mrEn1-Pet1 neurons – i.e. to mrEn1-Pet1→SCN
neurons. We therefore labelled mrEn1-Pet1→SCN
neurons and their upstream inputs simultaneously
and performed high-resolution imaging and 3D
