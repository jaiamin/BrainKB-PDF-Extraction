Methods
Animals
All experimental procedures were approved by the Harvard Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice
were raised and housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle, unless otherwise specified, under constant temperature
(22±1°C) and humidity (40-50%). For short, long, and reverse-to-equinox photoperiod studies, mice were
transferred to a dedicated, neighbouring room with independent light/dark control and ZT0 always at 0700 h, and
exposed to either 19 h light/ 5 h dark cycle (short photoperiod), 5 h light/ 19 h dark cycle (long photoperiod), or
12 h light/ 12h dark (equinox) for at least 2 weeks, according to previously published protocols6,14,36. Mice of
both sexes (equal numbers) were 60-70 days old at the start of every experimental procedure. All transgenics
were backcrossed to the C57BL/6J strain (#000664, Jax Labs) for at least 9 generations. En1tm2(cre)wrst/J mice51
,
referred to as En1-cre (Jax Lab #007916) were provided by A. Joyner. Slc17a8flox/flox mice52, referred to as
Vglut3flox/flox, were provided by R. Seal. Gt(ROSA)26Sortm65.1(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/

J mice, referred to as RC-Ai65 or R26C-
Ai65/+, were obtained from Jax Lab, stock #021875. Previously generated in the Dymecki lab were: Tg(Fev-
flpe)1Dym mice, referred to as Pet1-Flpe23; Gt(ROSA)26Sortm8(CAG-mDherry,-EGFP)Dym mice, referred to as RC-
FrePe25 or R26C-FrePe/+ (Jax Lab # 029486); Gt(ROSA)26Sortm10(CAG-Syp/EGFP*,-tdTomato)Dym mice, referred to as RC-
FPSit26 or R26C-FPSit/+ (Jax Lab #0030206); and Gt(ROSA)26Sortm(CAG-GFPTox*)Dym/J mice, referred to as RC-PFtox27

or R26C-PFtox/+. Experimental triple transgenic En1cre/+, Pet1-FlpeTg/0

, R26C-FrePe/+ mice or En1cre/+, Pet1-FlpeTg/0
,

R26C-FPSit/+ mice were generated by crossing double En1cre/+, Pet1-FlpeTg/0 studs to homozygous reporter R26C-
FrePe/C-FrePe or R26C-FPSit/C-FPSit females. Vglut3flox/flox mice were generated by crossing Vglut3foxlflox studs to

Vglut3flox/flox females. Double transgenic mice En1cre/+, Pet1-FlpeTg/0

mice were generated by crossing En1cre/+
,

Pet1-FlpeTg/0 studs to C57BL/6J females (#000664, Jax Labs). Trans heterozygotes R26C-PFtox/Ai65 or R26C-PFtox/C-
FrePe were generated by crossing either R26C-FrePe/C-FrePe or R26C-Ai65/C-Ai65 studs to R26C-PFtox/C-PFtox females.

Tissue preparation, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization
Histological analyses were performed on tissue harvested 2 h post light onset (Zeitgeber (ZT) 2 = 0900 h); light
onset (ZT 0) was fixed at 0700 h regardless of photoperiod length, which is varied by changing lights-off timing
at either 1900 h (ZT 12) for equinox, 1200 h (ZT 5) for short photoperiod, or 0200 h (ZT 19) for long photoperiod),
thus controlling for phase, except for the ZT 14 cohort of Fig. 1j). Mice were perfused transcardially with 0.1 M
PBS, followed by 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight
(20-24h) at 4°C. Tissue was either embedded in 2.5% agarose and vibratome sectioned (Leica VT1000S) or
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in tissue freezing medium (Tissue Tek, OCT), and then cryo-sectioned
(Leica): Twenty μm cryosections were used for dual immunofluorescence in situ hybridization, 50 μm vibratome
sections for immunofluorescence followed by wide-field or confocal imaging, 20 μm vibratome sections for
immunofluorescence followed by superresolution imaging.
For immunofluorescence experiments, tissue sections were permeabilized for 1h at room temperature in 0.1 M
PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 1.5 h incubation in blocking solution of 0.1 M
PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% Normal Donkey Serum (NDS, Jackson Immunoresearch). Sections
were then transferred in blocking solution containing primary antibodies and incubated for 1-2 overnights at 4°C.
After 3 washes in 0.1 M PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, sections were incubated in blocking solution
containing secondary antibodies for 2h at room temperature. Finally, sections were washed 3 times in 0.1 M PBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 solution, mounted onto 1.5 glass coverslips (Electron microscopy science) and
attached to Superfrost slides (ThermoFisher) using Prolong Gold mountant (ThermoFisher) for widefield and
confocal imaging or Prolong Glass mountant (ThermoFisher) for superresolution imaging. We used the following
primary antibodies: anti-GFP (chicken polyclonal, 1:1000, Aves Labs GFP-1020); anti-5-HT (goat polyclonal,
1:500; Abcam #ab66047); anti-VGLUT3 (guinea pig polyclonal, 1:500, Synaptic Systems #135–204); anti-RFP

(rat monoclonal, 1:1000, Chromotek #5f8 used to stain for virally-expressed tdTomato only in the dual immuno-
in situ while for all other experiments endogenous tdTomato fluorescence was visualized); anti-Fluorogold (rabbit

polyclonal, 1:3000, Millipore AB153-I); anti-Cre (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Biolegend #908001); anti-TPH2 (goat
polyclonal, 1:1000, Abcam #ab121013); and species-matched donkey secondary antibodies (1:500) conjugated
