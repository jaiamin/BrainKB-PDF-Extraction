explain the latter, it is important to note that this
employed approach using current tools to maximize
cell-selectivity for deletion of Vglut3 nonetheless
does so in all SCN-projecting neurons, thus not only
mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neurons but also a serotonergic,
non-glutamatergic (Vglut3-

) subset of the MRN

neuron group called r2Hoxa2-Pet17,37

. Across these
two MRN neuron groups that project to the SCN
collectively (mrEn1-Pet1→SCN and
r2Hoxa2Pet1→SCN neurons), only ~50% of the soma
express Vglut3 transcript and VGLUT3 protein, i.e.

the mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neuron subtype; r2Hoxa2-
Pet1→SCN neurons do not37 (corresponding to the
VGLUT3-negative subset in AAVretro-tdTomato
injected animals; Fig. 3d). We surmise that no other
VGLUT3+

neuron population projects to the SCN
because the VGLUT3+ boutons in the SCN always
colocalize with 5-HT (across photoperiod
conditions) and thus are from Pet1 neurons.
Collectively, these data suggest that the employed
genetic approach results in functional loss of
VGLUT3 selectively in mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neurons.
Next, we checked whether Vglut3 deletion in
SCN-projecting Pet1 neurons would cause circadian
disturbances in mice continuously exposed to
equinox conditions. AAVretro-Cre-injected
Vglut3flox/flox (conditional knockout, cKO) mice
showed no gross circadian abnormalities and were

indistinguishable from control AAVretro-tdTomato-
injected Vglut3flox/flox mice (Extended data Fig. 5a-d).

Next, we exposed a separate cohort of cKO and
control mice to short photoperiod and monitored
