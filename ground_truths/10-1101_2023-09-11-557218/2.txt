synchronization to day-length changes. Combining
intersectional genetics, viral circuit tracing, and
pathway-specific genetic and neuronal
manipulations with measurements of physical and
sleep/wake activity, we discovered in mice a preoptic
area-to-brainstem-to-hypothalamus neural circuit
and novel phenomenon of axon branch-specific and
periodic neurotransmitter deployment that together
prove critical for behavioural and sleep adaptation to
seasonally relevant photoperiod change. Thus,
identified is a cellular mechanism as well as a circuit
that links internal rhythms to external stimuli.
Brain region-specific and differential
neurotransmitter deployment by axon
collaterals of the dual serotonin-glutamate
neuron type mrEn1-Pet1
Previously, we identified mrEn1-Pet1 neurons as a
molecularly and developmentally distinct subtype of
5-HT-producing neuron resident in the mouse
MRN7,23,24 (Fig. 1a-c). As indicated by the name
mrEn1-Pet1, these median raphe (mr) neurons can be
accessed genetically through the combined

expression of the gene En1 encoding a fate-
specifying homeobox transcription factor, and Pet1

(aka Fev) encoding an ETS-family transcriptional
regulator of serotonergic pathway genes. To
visualize and manipulate these neurons, we use mice
transgenic for Pet1-Flpe23 and En1-cre51 along with
dual Cre/Flp-dependent (intersectional) reporters
(e.g. RC-FrePe25

, RC-FPSit

26; Fig. 1b) or effector

transgenes27

, or engineered stereotaxically injected
viruses that allow for spatial targeting of just the mr
(as opposed to dorsal raphe) group of En1-Pet1
neurons. In previous work, we sorted fluorescently
labelled mrEn1-Pet1 neurons followed by single-cell
transcriptomic analyses7

, which revealed that
mrEn1-Pet1 neurons not only express the expected
Tph2 gene, which encodes the rate limiting enzyme
in 5-HT synthesis, but also express the Vglut3 gene,
which encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter
type 3 for packaging glutamate into synaptic
vesicles. This finding suggests that mrEn1-Pet1
neurons may transmit using glutamate as well as 5-
HT; indeed, for other 5-HTergic neurons such as in
the dorsal raphe, VGLUT3 has been demonstrated to
be sufficient for glutamate neurotransmission28,29
. In
GFP-labelled mrEn1-Pet1 neurons, we confirmed
presence of Vglut3 transcripts using single molecule
fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNAscope)

coupled with GFP immunodetection (Fig. 1d-e), and,
furthermore, detected VGLUT3 protein along with
5-HT immunoreactivity (Fig. 1f). We then mapped
the En1-Pet1 efferent boutons (en passant and

terminal) illuminated via synaptophysin-GFP (Syp-
GFP) in triple transgenic En1-cre; Pet1-Flpe; RC-
FPSit mice (aka En1cre/+; Pet1-FlpeTg/0;

Gt(ROSA)26Sortm10(CAG-Syp/EGFP1,-tdTomato)Dym/+ ) (Fig.
1b,g), finding dense innervation of the SCN, as
expected from our previous work24 (Fig. 1h), but now
applying super-resolution imaging, we found that the
mrEn1-Pet1 boutons innervating the SCN harbour 5-
HT but not VGLUT3. And while levels of 5-HT and
mRNA for Tph2 in general have been reported to
vary over the sleep/wake cycle30,31, this VGLUT3
configuration we observed in tissue harvested at
Zeitgeber (ZT) 2 (0900 hrs; highest sleep pressure)
was indistinguishable from tissue harvested at ZT14
(2100 hrs; lowest sleep pressure) suggesting stability
across the sleep/wake cycle (Fig. 1i-j).
To corroborate the finding that mrEn1-Pet1
neurons lack VGLUT3 at their SCN terminals
despite showing expression at the soma, we
performed AAV-mediated retrograde tracing from
the SCN, allowing direct comparison of soma and
bouton neurochemical phenotype. We therefore
infused a mixture of AAV-CAG-GFP (to mark the
injection site) and AAVretro-CAG-tdTomato (which
preferentially transduces projecting neurons32) in the

SCN of triple transgenic En1-cre; Pet1-Flp; RC-
FrePe mice (aka En1cre/+; Pet1-FlpeTg/0;

Gt(ROSA)26Sortm8(CAG-mCherry,-EGFP)Dym/+) in which
mrEn1-Pet1 neurons express EGFP (Fig. 1l,
Extended Data Fig.1). We found that the mrEn1-Pet1
neurons that project to the SCN (mrEn1-Pet1→SCN) –
in this approach highlighted by the simultaneous
presence of intersectionally-encoded EGFP and viral
tdTomato – are a small subset within the broader
mrEn1-Pet1 domain (Fig. 1m-n) and are
preferentially located in the rostral MRN (Fig. 1p).
~Eighty percent of the mrEn1-Pet1→SCN soma
showed detectable VGLUT3 (Fig. 1o). We
confirmed this finding using the retrograde dye
Fluorogold infused in the SCN of En1-cre, Pet1-
Flpe, RC-FrePe mice (Extended Data Fig. 2), ruling
out synaptic bias by AAVretro. In both tracing
experiments, no dorsal raphe En1-Pet1 neuron
projection to the SCN was observed, as expected.
