Statistical analysis
Statistical tests (two-sided) were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. No statistical methods were used to
predetermine sample size. Mean ± s.e.m. was used to report statistics. Significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Details of the tests used, group numerosity and multiple hypotheses corrections can be found in the corresponding
figure legends and in Multiple Comparisons Tables.
