Flpe; RC-FPSit mice and observed double-labelled
SypGFP, tdTomato boutons in the SCN (Extended
Data Fig. 3d-g), confirming this pattern of
collaterals. These data indicate that dual transmitter
mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neurons segregate 5-HT versus
glutamate (proxy VGLUT3) to distinct collaterals
innervating different brain regions, suggesting
differential deployment of neurotransmitters in a
branch- and region-specific manner.
Shift from equinox to short/long
photoperiod induces branch-specific
reorganization of neurotransmitter
deployment
Because changes in photoperiod duration and
timing can induce switching of neurotransmitter
usage by neurons in the SCN6

, we queried whether
neurotransmitter deployment by mrEn1-Pet1→SCN
neurons might change upon shifting away from
equinox to long or short photoperiod conditions. We
exposed En1-cre, Pet1-Flpe, RC-FPSit mice, having
previously been reared in equinox photoperiod
conditions, to either long (19h light/5h dark) or short
(5h light/19h dark) photoperiod for 2 weeks during
adulthood6,14,36 (Fig. 2a) before harvesting brain
tissue 2 h post light onset (light onset is fixed across
conditions) for in situ phenotyping of mrEn1Pet1
boutons. We found that the shift to long photoperiod
exposure increased the percentage of triple positive
(SypGFP+
–5-HT+
–VGLUT3+

) mrEn1-Pet1 boutons
in the SCN up to 30% without changing the overall
number of GFP+

boutons; and more strikingly, the
shift to short photoperiod exposure increased the
fraction of triple positive boutons up to 65% (Fig.
2b,d), again with the number of GFP+

boutons per
field of view being unchanged across photoperiod
conditions (Fig. 2c, f). When we exposed a separate
cohort of En1-cre, Pet1-Flpe, RC-FPSit mice to
short photoperiod for 2 weeks (Fig 2e), followed by
standard equinox conditions for 2 weeks, we found
that the percentage of triple positive mrEn1-Pet1
boutons in the SCN returned to previous equinox
levels (<1%; Fig. 2g), suggesting reversibility of this
VGLUT3 deployment.
To study whether VGLUT3 deployment in
PVT- and Sfi-innervating collaterals varies across

photoperiods, we infused a mixture of AAV-CAG-
tdTomato and AAVretro-CAG-tdTomato in the SCN

of triple transgenic En1-cre, Pet1-Flpe, RC-FPSit

mice and exposed them to either equinox, long, or
short photoperiod for 2 weeks (Fig. 2h; Extended
data Fig.4). PVT collaterals of mrEn1-Pet1→SCN
neurons were devoid of VGLUT3 in equinox
conditions; long photoperiod exposure increased the
percentage of triple positive mrEn1-Pet1 boutons
(SypGFP+
, tdTomato+

, VGLUT3+

) to 25%, while the
increase was ~75% following short photoperiod
exposure (Fig. 2i-j), mirroring the neurotransmitter
re-organization observed in mrEn1-Pet1 boutons in
the SCN. Sfi-innervating collaterals remained
VGLUT3+
, 5-HT+

double-positive across the
different photoperiod conditions (Fig. 2i-j).
A possible mechanism by which mrEn1-
Pet1→SCN neurons could augment VGLUT3 synaptic
localization is through increased Vglut3 gene
transcription. To explore this possibility, we infused

a mixture of AAV-CAG-tdTomato and AAVretro-
CAG-tdTomato in the SCN of En1-cre, Pet1-Flpe,

RC-FPSit mice, exposed them to either equinox or
short photoperiod (Fig. 2k-l), and performed in situ
detection of Vglut3 transcripts concomitant with
immunodetection of Syp-GFP (sufficient expression
to illuminate soma) and viral tdTomato to distinguish
the mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neurons. Transduced neurons
showed comparable anatomical distribution between
conditions (Fig. 2m, o ) and analyses showed similar
number of Vglut3 transcripts per cell in mrEn1-
Pet1→SCN neurons or other neighbouring mrEn1-Pet1
neurons (SypGFP+

, tdTomato-

, not projecting to the
SCN), in response to short photoperiod exposure
(Fig. 2n). This suggests that post-transcriptional (e.g.

mRNA trafficking), translational, or post-
translational (e.g. local translation, protein

trafficking) mechanisms might underlie this
reversible, photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter
reorganization undertaken by mrEn1-Pet1→SCN
neurons.

Conditional loss of Vglut3 in SCN-
projecting neurons impairs adaptation to

change in daylength
We hypothesized that this dynamic system of axon
branch-specific neurotransmitter deployment by
mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neurons is a cellular mechanism
underlying organismal adaptation to change in
photoperiod. Disrupting such deployment thus might
cause circadian and sleep dysfunctions in response to
changes in daylength, without affecting behaviour in
