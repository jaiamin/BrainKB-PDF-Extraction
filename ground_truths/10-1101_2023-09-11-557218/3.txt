Fig. 1. mrEn1-Pet1 soma harbour serotonin and VGLUT3 yet only serotonin is detected in the synaptic boutons
innervating the SCN. a, Sagittal schematic representing the serotonergic raphe nuclei and location of the MRN. b,
Intersectional genetic strategy and Cre- and Flp-dependent expression of EGFP (from RC-FrePe allele) and SypGFP (from
RC-FPSit allele). * = mCherry cDNA in RC-FrePe. # = tdTomato cDNA in RC-FPSit. c, mrEn1-Pet1 neurons in the rostral
MRN of En1-cre;Pet1-Flp;RC-FrePe mice. d, Dual IF-ISH showing Vglut3 transcripts in mrEn1-Pet1 neurons (SypGFP+
in
En1-cre;Pet1-Flp;RC-FPSit mice). e, Vglut3 transcripts per cell. Colors=different mice. Dotted line=mean. f, Triple IF showing
costaining of 5-HT and VGLUT3 in GFP+ mrEn1-Pet1 neurons (in En1-cre;Pet1-Flp;RC-FrePe mice). g, Schematic showing
projections from mrEn1-Pet1 neurons to the SCN. h, mrEn1-Pet1 neuron presynaptic boutons (SypGFP-labelled) innervating
the SCN. Opt = optic nerve. i, Superresolution micrographs showing colocalization of SypGFP and 5-HT, but not with
VGLUT3, in the SCN. j, Quantification of SypGFP+ boutons positive for 5-HT and/orVGLUT3 in the SCN assayed at two
opposite time points of the circadian cycle. ZT = Zeitgeber. k, Retrograde tracing from the SCN. l, Representative image of the
injection site. m, Representative image of retrogradely labelled cells in the MRN. n, SCN-projecting mrEn1-Pet1 soma show
detectable VGLUT3. o, Quantification of the neurochemical phenotype of SCN-projecting mrEn1-Pet1 neurons. p, Heatmap
showing the anatomical position of SCN-projecting mrEn1-Pet1 soma. All data expressed as mean ± s.e.m.
Because serotonergic axons typically
collateralize to multiple brain regions33–35, we
explored the innervation profile specifically of the
mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neuron subgroup. We infused a

mixture of AAV-CAG-tdTomato and AAVretro-
CAG-tdTomato in the SCN of En1-cre; Pet1-Flpe;

RC-FPSit mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a-b). We found
collaterals of mrEn1-Pet1→SCN neurons (double

labeled with intersectional Syp-GFP and viral
tdTomato) in the Paraventricular Nucleus of the
Thalamus (PVT) and in the Septofimbrial Nucleus
(Sfi) (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Notably, VGLUT3
was detectable in the collaterals to the Sfi but not
PVT (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Next, we infused
AAVretro-CAG-tdTomato in the PVT and
separately Sfi of triple transgenic En1-cre; Pet1-
