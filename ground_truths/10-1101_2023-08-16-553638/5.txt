brighter colors or higher intensities. These salient regions correspond to the areas 141
that strongly influence the model’s prediction. 142
5. Extraction of latent feature 143
After training the model, the output of the one before the last layer of the model 144
was extracted for each input. The layer is circled in the Figure1.B. This output 145
essentially serves as a feature vector within the resultant latent space. Based on 146
this feature vector, we gauged the similarity amongst regions. That is, small 147
distances between feature vectors indicated higher similarities (Figure1.C). The 148
feature vectors were added together for each region, and those added vectors were 149
used as the concatenated vectors in that region. We calculated and compared the 150
distances of concatenated vectors for each of the seven regions, under the 151
assumption that the distance between concatenated vectors across regions reflects 152
inter-region similarity. 153
SVM 154
To evaluate whether the transformer-based model had any advantage over other simpler 155
methods, we obtained a simple baseline performance using Support Vector Machine 156
(SVM). We used the same spectrograms as input for training a linear SVM. The data 157
preprocessing technique used for the TERA model was applied to preprocess the 158
spectrogram in the same way. This involved performing the common average referencing 159
(CAR) and cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVM) subtraction as 160
preprocessing steps. For each individual, an SVM was trained using the labeled 161
electrode regions as the target labels, with the preprocessed data serving as input. After 162
the preprocessing, the spectrograms were transformed into one-dimensional vectors of 163
(feature length)×(time length). The training data consisted of 80% of the overall data, 164
while the remaining 20% was used as the test data. The data were standardized before 165
training the model. 166
