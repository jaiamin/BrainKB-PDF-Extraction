Our results showed that a deep learning model called TERA can indeed predict the 242
region of an electrode based on the spectrogram computed from a 20 seconds of single 243
channel ECoG signals. While this indicates that the temporal patterns of ECoG signals 244
contain the characteristics pertinent to the target region, it was not clear what patterns 245
actually enabled the prediction. It was perplexing that while simple frequency profiles 246
were not sufficient for successful prediction, shuffling the spectrograms in the temporal 247
domain did not substantially impair the prediction accuracy. The results of our saliency 248
mapping did not provide unequivocal insights as to the underlying contributing features. 249
A plausible interpretation for these results is that our model identified transient 250
events specific to each region. For instance, upon examining the saliency maps for 251
individual time segments, we sporadically noticed fleeting highly salient moments across 252
all frequencies coinciding with high gamma activation. These transient events coupled 253
with other subtle attributes may have played a role in making predictions. However, we 254
were not able to pinpoint definitive patterns that consistently served as hallmark 255
features for regional classification. This remains a significant constraint of our present 256
study and a more in-depth exploration is required to comprehensively grasp these 257
underlying characteristics. 258
In addition to showing the possibility of predicting the region of the electrode, we 259
explored the similarities and differences in the ECoG signatures across brain regions. To 260
this end, we used the trained neural network models as a way to create feature vectors 261
for each region and constructed a similarity matrix across the seven brain regions. The 262
results shown in Figure.4 show that brain regions are split into two clusters: the HVC 263
and TC formed one cluster while others made another. This suggests that ECoG signals 264
in the temporal cortex are distinct from the rest of the cortex. Those regions in the 265
temporal cortex belonged to the so-called ventral visual pathway associated with 266
high-level vision [29â€“31]. Additionally, we observed subtler subclusters, denoting 267
similarities between the early visual cortex and parietal cortex, as well as between 268
somatomotor and premotor areas. These cortical configurations hint at a division of 269
dynamics into the ventral pathway, dorsal pathway, and motor-related clusters. 270
Such demarcations might reflect diverse characteristics of the inherent neuron 271
populations. For example, the contrasts between the ventral and dorsal pathway 272
clusters might originate from variations in their connectivity and functions. The ventral 273
and dorsal pathways are known for their distinct architectures, topographies, and 274
connections [32]. Neurons in the frontal lobe are markedly more spinous than their 275
counterparts in other lobes. [33]. Differences manifest in the spine count of the basal 276
dendritic trees of pyramidal cells across V1, V2, and PFC, as well as in their dendritic 277
tree sizes [34]. Moreover, distinctions in spine size, cell count, and size between the 278
dorsal and ventral stream areas have been documented [35, 36]. According to 279
quantitative cytoarchitectonics, it is observed that dorsal and ventral pathways are 280
separated in the clusters [37]. Any of these variations may contribute to the unique 281
temporal dynamics in ECoG signals that allowed for the classification of the region of 282
origin. 283
In summary, our study aimed to determine whether distinct cortical areas exhibit 284
unique electrophysiological markers. Utilizing ECoG signals and the capabilities of the 285
TERA deep learning model, we successfully classified electrodes into one of seven 286
regions. This classification underscores the potential variations within the cortex. 287
However, the specific patterns responsible for this accurate classification remain less 288
clear, especially given the unexpected results from our frequency profile and time 289
domain experiments. We speculated that transient events and other subtle features that 290
might play crucial roles in predicting the region from ECoG signals. In examining 291
similarities and differences in latent features across regions, we found evidence 292
suggesting that ECoG dynamics could be segmented into distinct clusters. These 293
