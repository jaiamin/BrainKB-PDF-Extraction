based on those concatenated vectors obtained for each region (Figure1.C) as follows. Let 226
a and b be two representative vectors, the distance between vectors can be obtained as 227

cos θ =
a · b
∥a∥∥b∥

The Cosine Similarity diagram (Figure4) shows that both HVC and TC were 228
independent of other regions and the other regions forms one cluster. Within the big 229
cluster, MSC and PMC, and LVC and PC, respectively formed subclusters. These 230
results suggest that ECoG signals derived from the temporal cortex exhibit more 231
distinct characteristics compared to other regions. 232

Figure 4. This is the Similarity matrix between the regions. Concatenated Vectors
were created by adding the Feature Vectors for each region, and the distance between
the concatenated Vectors for each region was calculated using cosine similarity.
Discussion 233
The purpose of this study was to test whether different cortical regions exhibit distinct 234
electrophysiological characteristics. We used ECoG signals obtained from each electrode 235
for classifying the corresponding electrode’s region into one of seven categories, as 236
delineated by anatomical criteria. Our anticipation was grounded in the notion that the 237
diversity in cytoarchitecture and distinct connectivities across regions would manifest as 238
discernible temporal patterns in their respective ECoG signals. Thus we hypothesized 239
that deep learning models would be able to learn those distinct temporal patterns and 240
determine which region the ECoG belonged to. 241
