observations might reflect underlying neuronal properties, ranging from dendritic 294
structures to cytoarchitectural differences. Our findings have added to the existing body 295
of knowledge on the cortex’s electrophysiological properties, and we anticipate further 296
research will continue to clarify these complex relationships. 297
