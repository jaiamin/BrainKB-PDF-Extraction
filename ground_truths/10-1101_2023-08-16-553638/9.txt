Similarities of cortical regions 218
In order to assess the similarity between regions, we extracted the activation patterns 219
from the layer just before the last layer of the trained model. This vector was used as 220
the feature vector of the region to which the input ECoG data belonged, and this 221
feature vector was used to examine the similarity between the regions. The similarity 222
between regions was quantified using Cosine Similarity. For each region, the feature 223
vectors were extracted for each 20-second segment and then concatenated to make a 224
long vector spanning over the entire period. Similarities between regions were computed 225
