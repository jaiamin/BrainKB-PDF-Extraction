not clear. To address this, we hypothesized that the frequency profiles of the regions 178
might play a role. To evaluate this, we calculated the average power for each frequency 179
by compressing the spectrogram over its temporal dimension, and then assessed the 180
trained model to determine any degradation in prediction accuracy. If the model relies 181
on primarily frequency information only, it is expected that even if the temporal 182
information is removed by averaging, prediction accuracy would remain high. On the 183
other hand, if the model relies on the combination of both frequency and temporal 184
information, then the averaging would degrade the accuracy. 185
The results of this analysis are shown in Figure2.B. Contrary to our expectation, the 186
prediction accuracy was at chance levels. This implies that the predictions were not 187
solely reliant on the frequency power profile. Instead, the model seems to be attuned to 188
more intricate features within the time-frequency data. 189
To further understand the contributing features, we shuffled the time of the input 190
spectrogram to see how much the model relied on temporal features. Figure2.C shows 191
the F value between individuals in each region using spectrogram, of which temporal 192
component was shuffled. It is observed that the F-values did not change significantly 193
compared to Figure2.A. This suggests that the temporal structure in the spectrogram 194
plays little role in the prediction of the region. The combined results from these two 195
additional analyses may be somehow perplexing because powerspectrum alone is not 196
sufficient for successful prediction, suggesting the relevance of temporal information, 197
whereas shuffling the temporal order did not harm the performance. Possible 198
interpretations of these results will be discussed in the discussion section. 199
Finally, we show the results from our baseline performance obtained with linear 200
SVM. Figure2.D shows the F value between individuals in each region using SVM. From 201
this figure, it appears that the F-values are close to the chance level. This suggests that 202
when using the simple baseline model SVM, as compared to TERA, it was not able to 203
capture the ECoG features effectively in each region. 204
In addition to those attempts to reveal contributing features by degrading the input 205
data, we also applied methods to visualize which portion of the data the model paid 206
attention to for making predictions. Figure3 visualizes the saliency map of the model 207
using the gradient of the model. The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is 208
frequency, and the Saliency Map visualizes the features that the model pays attention 209
to. The trial average, the average of correct cases, and the average of incorrect cases 210
were calculated for each region for each individual. The highlighted horizontal bands in 211
those figures suggest that the model focuses mainly on frequency components. The 212
appearance of temporal changes at a certain moments may suggest that the model may 213
be capturing a temporal feature. On a single trial basis, we often observed temporally 214
specific attention that appeared as brief vertical lines that overlapped with high gamma 215
activities. Such brief events may have also made contributions to the prediction 216
accuracy. 217
