Figure 6: Electrophysiological recordings of 3D neuronal cultures after 13 DIV. a: A representative 1 min
raster plot of spontaneous activity captured by 19 electrodes in a single module. Each spike is represented by a
vertical line. Bursting occurred roughly every 5 s synchronized on all electrodes. b: Representative voltage traces
of five electrodes, with raster plots of spikes at one electrode, bursts from all electrodes, and network bursts.
c: Threshold-aligned waveforms of 100 spikes measured at a single electrode revealed the expected waveform of
an extracellular axonal action potential, with an amplified amplitude (here, 330 μV peak-to-peak). d: Acute
application of 3 μM PTX increased spike frequency, illustrated by five representative voltage traces, and raster
plots of spikes at one electrode, all bursts, and network bursts.
4 Conclusions
Here, we reported on the development of a two-compartment microphysiological system for the
morphological and electrophysiological assessment of 3D neuronal cultures, and demonstrated its
capabilities with primary 3D cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. We developed this system to be
compatible with automated liquid handling and commercial amplifier systems, although we note that
the culture modules (with 12 in our format) can be extended to multiwell format devices with higher
numbers of modules and electrodes.
Our devices reliably achieved simple and non-invasive recording of electrical activity due to the
unguided outgrowth of neurites from non-adherent cells into substrate-integrated tunnels having
integrated microelectrodes. The devices were also capable of simultaneous microscopy to observe
morphology of the 3D neuronal culture.
