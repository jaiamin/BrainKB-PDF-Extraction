drying with nitrogen required aiming the nitrogen pistol at the channel openings to clear solvents from
them. The metal foil spacer was removed during development.
The microfluidic MEAs were finally hard-baked in an oven at 200°C for 30 min (ramping up and down
at 0.5 °C/min) to complete cross-linking for chemical stability (Jones, 2017) and to prevent toxicity
(Baëtens et al., 2020).
An array of wells was milled out of COC (Topas 6013) then cleaned in acetone and isopropanol. The
microfluidic MEA and wells were treated with air plasma for 90 s, then glued together (Figure S3) with
EPO-TEK 301-2FL (Epoxy Technology, Billerica, MA, USA) by wicking of the liquid adhesive between
the ADEX and COC surfaces (Lu et al., 2008), and cured in an oven at 80 °C for 3 h with ramping up
and down at 0.5 °C/min.

Figure 2: Microfluidic fabrication process. Fabrication begins with a glass substrate with gold microelectrodes
(1). The upper surface is silicon nitride, and ITO electrical paths (height ~200 nm) are omitted for simplicity.
Tunnels are produced in a spin-coated layer of SU-8 (3 μm) (2). Compartments are defined by a laminated layer
of SUEX (150 μm) (3) and enclosed by a laminated ceiling of ADEX (20 μm) (4).
2.2 Cell culture
Preparation of primary mouse hippocampal neurons
Primary cultures were prepared with dissociated hippocampal neurons of Swiss mice (Janvier Labs,
France). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Union (EU) and German
legislation for the care and use of laboratory animals (Directive 2010/63/EU, of the European
Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, German Tierschutzgesetz).
Isolation of hippocampi from day 16 embryos (E16) was performed based on previously published
work (Seibenhener and Wooten, 2012). The cell dissociation procedure followed the guidelines of the
Neural Dissociation Kit (T) (130-093-231, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany). After filtering with medium
with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (10082139, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, US), cells were counted
(NucleoCounter® NC-200TM, ChemoMetec A/S, Denmark), centrifuged, and resuspended in plating
medium based on Neurobasal Plus Medium (A3582901, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, US)
with 2 % (v/v) of SM1 Neuronal Supplement (5711, STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Germany) and
0,5 % (v/v) of Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (P4333-20mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Germany).
