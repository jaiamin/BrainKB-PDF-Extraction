1 Introduction
Neurological disorders affect more than 90 million people worldwide (World Health Organization,
2006) and the incidence is expected to rise due to population aging. Despite enormous investments in
drug development, attrition rates of neuroactive compounds are greater compared to other drugs
(Dowden and Munro, 2019). Current in vitro and animal models employed for drug discovery or
neuroscience research do not adequately simulate the pathophysiological condition of the human
nervous system and have limited readout (Marx et al., 2016).
Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures are convenient in vitro platforms for carrying out a detailed
analysis of the neuronal response. In 2D cultures, cells grow adherent on planar substrates. These
culture models emulate certain aspects of neurophysiology and enable higher throughput and lower
complexity than in vivo models. However, planar adherent cultures do not represent the complexity of
the neuronal circuits and the intricate connection between the neurons (Marx, 2018). Monolayers of
neurons attached to rigid surfaces are limited to contact with surrounding cells and lack the
extracellular matrix. In an effort to generate more predictive in vitro models that better mimic aspects

of the physiology of the human brain, organ-on-chip technology combining microfluidics and three-
dimensional (3D) culture techniques has emerged in the last decade (Mastrangeli et al., 2019).

A key distinction in 3D cultures is whether the cells are self-organized by bottom-up mechanisms or
are engineered with top-down mechanisms. Bottom-up neural systems include brain organoids
(Lancaster et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018; McDonald et al., 2023) and neurospheres (Fan et al.,
2016). Top-down systems are usually dissociated neurons or other cells distributed in a scaffold. In
either case, the cultures may include various types of cells with varying distribution and may include a
scaffold or extracellular matrix. In organoids, the types and distribution of cells depends on guiding
natural mechanisms of differentiation and proliferation. In contrast, top-down control can directly
include mature cell types at desired densities (Jentsch, 2021). Our work presents a top-down
approach in which culture conditions and distribution of cells can be defined for specific applications.
Differences between cells cultured in 2D and 3D include levels of gene expression (Kamei et al., 2016;
Papadimitriou et al., 2018; Tekin et al., 2018) and electrical activity (Xu et al., 2009). Neurons in 3D
can develop a more physiological morphology (Lancaster et al., 2013; Todd et al., 2013). An
extracellular matrix or scaffold can support the formation of distinct regions or barriers as in the brain
(Wevers et al., 2016). Moreover, microfluidics enables perfusion to imitate the fluid flow, including
nutrients, gases and secreted substances (Koo et al., 2018; Papadimitriou et al., 2018; Wevers et al.,
2018).
The extra spatial dimension of 3D cultures makes measuring the properties and activity of cells more
challenging. Most work examines morphology and relies on calcium imaging to measure activity,
without electrophysiology (Hopkins et al., 2015; Mofazzal Jahromi et al., 2019). Unfortunately,
measuring the activity of deeper layers of neuronal organoids and 3D cultures remains a challenge
and requires new technological approaches (Keller and Frega, 2019). Recent approaches include
integration of microelectrodes in 3D arrays using complex assembly methods (Soscia et al., 2020;
Shin et al., 2021) or designing 2D arrays to be embedded within 3D cultures (Le Floch et al., 2022;
McDonald et al., 2023).
In fact, a promising approach is to develop new microelectrode arrays (MEA) with integrated
microfluidic structures (Neto et al., 2016). Direct fabrication of microfluidics on microelectrode arrays
allows alignment with optical precision (~1 μm), and can be scalable. A challenge is the vertical height
of required microfluidic structures, which must be >100 μm for 3D cell culture.
Similar work has traditionally relied on placing microfluidic devices made of polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) on conventional glass microelectrode arrays, defining interconnected compartments for
multiple cell populations (Honegger et al., 2013; Odawara et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2016; Kilic et al.,
2016; Adriani et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Izzi, 2021; Mateus et al., 2021).
Alignment between the microfluidic device and the MEA often uses flip-chip methods with accuracy of
only ~10 μm. Moreover, PDMS has well known drawbacks for substance testing due to absorption of
hydrophobic compounds (Toepke and Beebe, 2006; van Meer et al., 2017). Using 2D adherent cell
culture, such PDMS microfluidic chips with interconnected compartments have been used to study
axonal transport (Lu et al., 2012), unidirectional axonal growth (Peyrin et al., 2011; Malishev et al.,
