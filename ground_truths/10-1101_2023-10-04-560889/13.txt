electron transport chain. Strikingly, plotting all protein-coding genes transcribed from mtDNA
showed a specific downregulation of almost all of them in the pLNA-1229 condition (Fig. 4c),
while various genes related to mitochondrial metabolism are upregulated upon miR-1229-3p
knockdown (Suppl. fig. S19a). Since neither the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
complex I genes (Suppl. fig. S19b) nor predicted nuclear targets of the mitochondrial
transcription factor TFAM were altered (Suppl. fig. S19c), miR-1229-3p inhibition appears to
specifically affect mitochondrial gene expression. This effect is not due to increased mutation
frequency in the mitochondrial genome, since the number of SNPs in mitochondrial transcripts
is not altered by miR-1229-3p inhibition (Suppl. fig. S19d-e).
Human brains require more energy than those of closely related primates (27), and the speed of
neuronal development is chiefly determined by the mitochondrial metabolic rate (28). In
agreement, we see that the expression levels of mtDNA encoded genes as well as the abundance
of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are highly dynamic throughout neuronal development
(Suppl. fig. S20a-b). We therefore decided to study a potential regulation of mitochondrial
function by miR-1229-3p in further detail. To identify direct effectors of miR-1229-3p, which
might function upstream of the global changes in the mitochondrial transcriptome, we focused
on upregulated genes within the pLNA-1229 dataset (Suppl. fig. S17d). In the GO-term
analysis, top enriched biological processes with upregulated genes included “autophagy of
mitochondrion” and “membrane fusion” (Fig. 4b). A more refined GO-term analysis
specifically on the candidate upregulated genes in the pLNA-1229 dataset (p-value < 0.05),
further showed a specific enrichment for terms related to autophagy (Fig. 4d). Four of the
autophagy-related upregulated genes contain high-affinity (7mer-a1 or stronger) miR-1229-3p
binding sites (Fig. 4e). Among those, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) was the most
significantly upregulated miR-1229-3p target gene in the pLNA-1229 dataset, containing an
8mer binding site near the polyA signal of its 3`UTR. Pink1 is involved in mitochondrial quality
control by guiding Parkin to depolarized mitochondria, thereby triggering a special form of
autophagy known as mitophagy (29). Using luciferase assays with a wild-type and miR-1229-
3p binding site mutant Pink1 3`UTR reporter gene constructs, we were able to validate Pink1
as a direct target of miR-1229-3p in a human cell line and rat primary neurons (Fig. 4f, Suppl.
fig. S20c). In conclusion, our results indicate that miR-1229-3p depletion profoundly impacts

mitochondrial gene expression and identify the mitophagy regulator Pink1 as a direct miR-
1229-3p target gene.
