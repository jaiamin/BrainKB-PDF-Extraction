of miRNAs can be safely classified as human-specific (25 miRNAs with no more than 60%
sequence conservation in any of the tested species) (Suppl. Table 1-5) in agreement with
previous publications (17, 21). Additionally, we discovered 52 miRNAs with human-specific
seed changes which are expected to have unique target genes in humans. Among this
conservative estimate of a total of 77 “human-specific” miRNAs, only four (the newly evolved
miR-4745-5p and miR-941, as well as the seed mutants miR-1229-3p and miR-3141) were
expressed in our dataset (Fig. 2c-d). While miR-941 is consistently expressed at high levels,
miR-4745-5p and miR-3141 change mostly from stem cell to neuron conversion and stay rather
constant during neuronal maturation. miR-1229-3p represents the only human-specific miRNA
with a dynamic expression pattern during the neuronal days of differentiation, suggesting a role
in human synaptogenesis. This finding was further corroborated when we performed gene-wise
linear regression of miRNA expression profiles with the neurodevelopmental trajectory inferred
by synapse density quantification (cf. Fig. 1c) from the same neuronal differentiations (Fig. 2e).
In contrast to the other three human-specific miRNAs, miR-1229-3p expression closely follows
synapse density development, as do known regulators of synaptogenesis such as miR-181c-5p
(22, 23).
Based on a structural conservation analysis of all human miRNA precursors with mismatches
in orthologs found in primates (excluding marmoset), miR-1229-3p shows the lowest structural
conservation index, despite a high sequence similarity (Fig. 2f, Suppl. fig. S12a). This lack of
structural conservation is further illustrated when plotting the predicted secondary structures of
human and chimp pre-miR-1229 (Fig. 2g). Since the predicted chimp pre-miR-1229 is lacking
a 2-nucleotide overhang at the 3’end of the precursor required for efficient Dicer-mediated
processing (24), no production of mature miR-1229-3p is expected in chimpanzee. In addition,
alignment of hsa-pre-miR-1229 with blasted sequences of higher apes shows the presence of
four human-specific point mutations, one of which is located in the seed region (Fig. 2h). In
agreement with the non-functionality of a putative chimp-miR-1229, expression of the chimp
miR-1229 mirtron, in contrast to its human counterpart, was unable to downregulate a perfect
miR-1229-3p binding site reporter in a luciferase assay (Fig. 2i, Suppl Fig. 12b). Finally, to
assess the conservation of predicted miR-1229-3p targets, we used scanMiR to inspect 3’UTR
sequences that we extracted from the chimp genome by lifting over human coordinates from
expressed 3’UTRs for potential miR-1229-3p binding sites (see methods). We noticed that
almost all binding sites are very well conserved between human and chimpanzee, even
regarding their predicted strength (Suppl. fig. S12c). This pattern holds similarly true for all
expressed miRNAs (Suppl. fig. S12d), suggesting that evolutionary adaptation of miRNA
regulation primarily occurred on the miRNA rather than on the target side. Taken together, four
point-mutations within the miR-1229 gene enabled efficient Dicer-mediated processing and the
recognition of evolutionary conserved target genes in human neurons.
