into HEK-cells together with synthetical miR-1229-3p or control (Ctrl.) mimics (5-20 pmol).
“Pink1 3’UTR mut.” contains three point mutations in the 8mer binding site (Fig. 4e). A linear
model with an interaction effect for the sequence, miRNA mimic and miRNA mimic amount
(including a fixed effect for the experiment) was used for the statistical analysis ( ~
condition*sequence*amount + experiment). Statistical comparisons were acquired using
emmeans by comparing the two conditions separately per amount and sequence
(sequence|condition|amount, reference = Ctrl., N = 5). (* = p-value < 0.05, ** = p-value < 0.01,
**** = p-value < 0.0001)

miR-1229-3p controls mitochondrial homeostasis during human excitatory
synaptogenesis.
Mitochondria homeostasis plays an essential role in regulating synaptic signaling and
development (28, 31). Given the profound impact of miR-1229-3p on the expression of
mitochondrial genes and the identification of Pink1 as a direct miR-1229-3p target gene, we
assessed the effects of miR-1229-3p depletion on mitochondrial morphology and homeostasis.
To monitor mitochondrial morphology in human neurons, we performed stainings with the
membrane potential sensitive dye Mitotracker (CMXRos) on day 27 of the neuronal
differentiation. We noticed the frequent presence of Mitotracker “puncta” with a high local
intensity almost exclusively in the soma of neurons treated with pLNA-1229 (Fig. 5a). Such
mitochondrial accumulations have been previously associated with mitophagy driven by the
Pink1/Parkin pathway (32). Mitotracker “puncta” repeatedly co-localized with the lysosomal
marker Lamp2 (Fig. 5b), suggesting that they represent mitophagosomes (33). Moreover,
human neurons treated with pLNA-1229 showed a significantly higher somatic entropy and
intensity of the Mitotracker signal in comparison to neurons treated with the scrambled control
(Fig. 5c-d), indicating elevated mitochondrial fragmentation. Together, these observations
suggest that premature excitatory synaptogenesis in miR-1229-3p depleted human neurons
correlates with enhanced mitophagy. These findings are consistent with earlier studies from
Drosophila and C. elegans, which reported reduced synaptogenesis in several mutants of the
autophagy pathway (34).
In addition to promoting mitophagy, the miR-1229-3p target gene Pink1 has been shown to
promote mitochondrial fission (35). In neurons, mitochondrial fission is required for
mitochondria to be transported to axons and has been shown to be essential for synapse
development (36, 37). We therefore quantified the Mitotracker signal in processes of human
neurons at day 23 and found a higher number of axonal mitochondria in the pLNA-1229
condition (Fig. 5e, Suppl. fig. S21a-e). In addition, we performed a detailed analysis of
mitochondria ultrastructure using live-cell super resolution imaging of human neurons at day
29 and day 36 (Fig. 5f). Consistent with enhanced mitochondrial fission upon miR-1229-3p

inhibition, mitochondrial organelle size (area and length) was significantly reduced in pLNA-
1229 compared to pLNA-Ctrl treated igNeurons at day36 (Fig. 5g, Suppl. fig. S22).

Excessive mitophagy reduces the cellular mitochondrial content, possibly causing reduced
mitochondrial metabolism (38, 39). This in turn would shift the provision of energy supply
towards glycolysis, reflected by enhanced lactate production (Fig. 5h). In line with a decreased
mitochondrial metabolic activity upon sustained miR-1229-3p depletion, we observed a
significantly increased lactate concentration in the media collected from pLNA-1229-treated
neurons in comparison to control neurons at day 36 (Fig. 5i). Besides energy provision, neuronal
mitochondria play an important role in calcium buffering and uptake upon stimulation,
particularly at presynaptic termini (31). Accordingly, it has been shown that mitochondria
