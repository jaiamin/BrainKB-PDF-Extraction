which however did not reach statistical significance. Surprisingly, quantification of
dendritogenesis showed a decrease of dendritic complexity upon depletion of miR-1229-3p
specifically at the later time point (Fig. 3f; Suppl. fig. S15a-c). Together, these results suggest
that miR-1229-3p initially functions as a repressor of excitatory synapse formation but is
required for dendritic branching during later stages of human neuron development.
To characterize the functional properties of igNeurons depleted from miR-1229-3p, we
performed patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC)
during the plateau phase when synapses had sufficiently matured (day 40-42) (Fig. 3g-h). At
this time point, igNeurons displayed spontaneous activity – a proxy for functional synapses and
cell-cell communication – at a similar frequency as human Ngn2-neurons cultured together with
astrocytes for 30-35 days (26), further confirming the suitability of our protocol to investigate
human excitatory synapse development. Interestingly, sEPSC quantification revealed a
significantly higher charge transfer in miR-1229-3p depleted neurons in comparison to the
control condition (Fig. 3i). Neurons treated with the pLNA-1229 showed in addition a trend
towards a higher sEPSC amplitude (p = 0.051), while the sEPSC frequency as well as rise and
decay time were not changed (Fig. 3i, Suppl. fig. S16a-c). Besides sEPSC-events, we also
detected occasional large-amplitude bursts (Fig. 3h, inset). Focusing on these bursts, we again
observed a significant increase in the total charge transfer upon depletion of miR-1229-3p, as
well as a trend towards an increased burst peak amplitude (p = 0.05) (Fig. 3j). The burst duration

remained unchanged (Suppl. fig. S16d). Together, these results demonstrate that the human-
specific miR-1229-3p controls the developmental timing of excitatory synaptogenesis and

impacts excitatory synaptic function.
