Fig. 4. miR-1229-3p regulates genes involved in mitochondrial homeostasis.
a) Volcano plot indicating significantly changing genes upon miR-1229-3p depletion.
Upregulated genes (FDR < 0.05) are displayed in yellow, downregulated genes (FDR < 0.05)
in blue. b) GO-Term analysis (biological processes) of significantly changing genes (FDR <
0.5) in the pLNA-1229 condition. Displayed are the top 15 significant GO-Terms with less than
500 genes annotated. The number of significantly changing genes within each GO-term is
represented by the red (downregulated) and yellow (upregulated) bars. c) Heatmap showing the
scaled expression of genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome in pLNA-treated igNeurons.

d) GO-Term analysis (biological processes) of upregulated genes (p-value < 0.05) in pLNA-
1229 treated igNeurons. The top 10 most significant GO-terms with more than 15 and less than

500 annotated genes are displayed. Yellow bars indicate the number of genes associated with
each GO-Term. e) Predicted miR-1229-3p binding sites in 3’UTRs of genes upregulated in
pLNA-1229 treated igNeurons and associated with the GO-Term autophagy. Shown are log(KD)
values (ScanMiR-predicted miRNA binding site affinity (30)) of canonical binding sites and
their position on the 3’UTR. f) Luciferase measurement of Pink1 3’UTR constructs transfected
