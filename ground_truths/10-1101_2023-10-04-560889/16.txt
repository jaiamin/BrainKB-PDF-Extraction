deactivation or a lack of mitochondria leads to elevated calcium levels in the cytoplasm and at
synapses upon stimulation (40, 41). We therefore performed Ca-imaging at day 37 of the
neuronal differentiation and indeed observed an increase of the calcium signal amplitude in
miR-1229-3p depleted neurons in comparison to the control (Fig. 5j) while the peak duration
was not changed (Suppl. fig. S23). These results corroborate the electrophysiological recordings
of spontaneous bursts in igNeurons treated with pLNA-1229 (cf. Fig. 3j and Suppl. fig. S16d).
Strikingly, activation of mitochondria by the addition of GSK-2837808A and AlbuMAX (28)
rescued the elevated calcium signal amplitude (Fig. 5j), demonstrating that impaired calcium
buffering in miR-1229-3p depleted human neurons is a consequence of disturbed mitochondrial
function. In conclusion, we show that interfering with miR-1229-3p during synaptogenesis
enhances mitophagy and mitochondrial fission, which ultimately leads to defects in calcium
buffering and metabolic function.
