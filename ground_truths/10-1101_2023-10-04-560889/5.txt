Fig. 1. A glial-free protocol to study human excitatory synapse development
a) Overview of our protocol to differentiate human neurons without the requirement to add glial
cells together with an example of igNeurons cultured for over 10 weeks and stained for MAP2
(red) and SYN1 (green). b) Example images of igNeurons used for the quantification of synapse
development at three different time points. Shown is MAP2 in grays, SYN1 in green and PSD95
in red. c) Synapse co-cluster quantification over five time points from three differentiations
(236 pictures in total, two coverslips (CVS) were imaged per time point and differentiation).
The detected number of co-clusters is normalized by the number of neurons and dendritic area
in each image. Shown are violin plots of all datapoints together with the mean and standard
deviation of each differentiation. Statistical analysis was performed on square root transformed
values. A robust linear model was applied over the aggregated means of each day and
differentiation to account for outliers in any of the time points ( ~ day + differentiation).
