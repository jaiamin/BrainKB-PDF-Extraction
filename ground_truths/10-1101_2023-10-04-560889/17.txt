development a) Confocal images displaying neurons stained for MAP2 (grays) and with
Mitotracker CMXRos (1:7500, ca. 130nM, red)) at day 27. Quantification was performed on
38 neurons of the pLNA-Ctrl condition and 39 neurons of the pLNA-1229 condition imaged
from two CVS. Shown are violin plots of all datapoints together with the mean and standard
